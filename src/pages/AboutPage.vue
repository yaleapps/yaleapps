                At 12:53 AM, four famished friends wondered, “What buttery is
                open right now?”

              Finding no answers, we set out to resolve this perennial question
              ourselves. In search of the sacred texts—the menu and hours of
              operation—we voyaged to the edges of Yale’s campus, from the
              extremities of Murray/Franklin to the backwaters of TD. Like good
              tourists, we left only footsteps and took only photographs. Like
              good gastronomers, we left (almost) no items unordered and sampled
              every regional speciality. And like good coders, we left no
              documentation unread and made only atomic commits.

              Powered by Hopper’s Mozz Sticks, in protest of Gheav’s sandwich
              monopolism and eager to fill our empty git-contribution graphs, we
              compiled this compendium.
