        "description": "It has been said that writing about music is like dancing about architecture–and indeed, evoking melody, harmony, and rhythm with words can challenge even the most observant and eloquent among us. In this course, students read and discuss writing on music by British and Commonwealth scholars and critics (e.g., Simon Frith and Dick Hebdige), journalists (Julie Burchill and Caitlin Moran), and even a novelist or two (Nick Hornby and Zadie Smith)–as well as a few Americans. They also attend multiple musical performances, including some musical theater; visit London exhibits, neighborhoods, and sites important in the history of British pop, rock, and reggae; and travel by train to Liverpool. The focus is on Anglo-American popular music of the past half-century-plus, and among the concepts to be investigated are style and taste. Written assignments include a critical review of a performance, a feature article, a literary essay on a musical topic, and an academic paper. The goal of the course is for students to improve their skills at observation, description, and analysis of culture.",

It is not intended as a history or material culture course; rather, as a study in classical reception: that is, how Greek and Roman material has been transmitted, translated, excerpted, interpreted, rewritten, re-imaged and represented in Britain from the Roman conquest through to the present. After a week’s introduction to the British Isles from the point of view of antiquity, we concentrate on material from the 18th-21st centuries. Each class asks students both to see antiquity through the eyes of the work/authors/artists assigned and to critique that gaze from their own, contemporary perspective.",

How can multisensory description bring the reader into our experience? Why do certain places stay with us?

Then they devote their time to profiling a Londoner found in the online Yellow Pages (Yell.com)—for instance, the owner of a kebab shop, a seller of secondhand books, a hydrographic surveyor of the River Thames.
