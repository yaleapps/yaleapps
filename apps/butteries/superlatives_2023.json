We discuss how the United States waged war—why the United States got into wars, and how the U.S. extricated itself (or tried to extricate itself) from war. The course also pays close attention to the relationship between war and state-building in the United States and abroad, as we cover topics such as the history of American occupations, the political economy of the American military, and the technology of modern warfare. By taking an expansive view of American military power, we therefore seek to understand how wartime, as well as \"peacetime,\" shaped the history of the United States throughout the twentieth century.",

From its origins in Arabia, Islam expanded across the globe and took deep root in diverse societies across Asia and Africa over the past 1,400 years. In this class, we explore the cultural and political dynamics of Islamization and vernacularization as themes of global Islamic history with particular reference to developments in South Asia. While South Asia is one of the main focal points of this course, connections and entanglements with neighboring regions, by land and sea, are explored thematically throughout the course. In particular, we look at the Ottoman and Safavid empires to the west, and the Indian Ocean world, including South East Asia. This vast region was diverse, in terms of language, religion, economic and social class, geography, and political leanings. Over this period, mobility, trade, communication, and exchange increased, resulting in more wealth accumulation and distribution; growth of knowledge production and exchange of ideas and books; better infrastructure, construction of buildings and cities, forts, and ports; and improved technology. Major topics include the spread of Islam, the development of vernacular Muslim cultures and its influence on the arts—including music, the rise of regional sultanates and empires, women, the impact of and reaction to European colonialism, the debate about the decline of Muslim empires, and finally the creation of modern nation-states and Muslims in non-Muslim majority countries.",

While the feeling of lonesomeness prompts some of the most important works in American literature, prior to 1800 the word \"loneliness\" did not exist in the English language. Today loneliness seems to be a necessary feature of our everyday lives, a natural symptom of our need to self-isolate during a global pandemic. We read widely in the literature of loneliness, primarily across the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, to understand how novelists, poets, critics, and artists represented the sensation of solitude within their cultural and political moments. While we examine the changing conditions of isolation in our country’s history, our focus remains on the politics of that feeling. Is loneliness a symptom of being abandoned by humanity, as Jill Stauffer argues? Or, as Wendell Berry claims, is solitude a necessary condition for \"[responding] more clearly to other lives\"? Throughout our thirteen weeks of remote learning, we unpack how our authors have grappled with solitude in its various forms. We also invite contemplation on the conditions of our isolation, reflecting critically on what isolation feels like and what it can teach us.",

        "description": "This course charts the literary history of the \"loneliness epidemic,\" as it is so often called. While the feeling of lonesomeness prompts some of the most important works in American literature, prior to 1800 the word \"loneliness\" did not exist in the English language. Today loneliness seems to be a necessary feature of our everyday lives, a natural symptom of our need to self-isolate during a global pandemic. We read widely in the literature of loneliness, primarily across the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, to understand how novelists, poets, critics, and artists represented the sensation of solitude within their cultural and political moments. While we examine the changing conditions of isolation in our country’s history, our focus remains on the politics of that feeling. Is loneliness a symptom of being abandoned by humanity, as Jill Stauffer argues? Or, as Wendell Berry claims, is solitude a necessary condition for \"[responding] more clearly to other lives\"? Throughout our thirteen weeks of remote learning, we unpack how our authors have grappled with solitude in its various forms. We also invite contemplation on the conditions of our isolation, reflecting critically on what isolation feels like and what it can teach us.",

They expressed themselves in the speculative fiction of Michael Crichton in terms of monsters: the virus in The Andromeda Strain, the androids in Westworld, the velociraptors of Jurassic Park, and even the patients maimed by gunshot wounds in ER.

        "description": "Children across America spend roughly 12,000 hours in school from kindergarten through grade 12. How those instructional hours are spent dramatically impacts students’ academic and personal well-being. Many studies have demonstrated that teacher quality matters to students’ long-term outcomes including graduation and job placement. In this course, we delve into the essential principles of being an effective teacher, focusing specifically on the U.S. secondary classroom. Building community, designing culturally sustaining curriculum, teaching inclusively, and assessing students authentically are a handful of the principles we explore together through articles about teacher practice, video examples of classroom practice, and students opportunity to enact some of these practices during class. Each student is paired with a current secondary public school teacher across America to engage in a case study of effective teaching throughout the seminar. By the end of this course, you learn some core principles of effective teaching, gain an understanding of the complexities of enacting effective teaching practices given educational inequities, conduct a case study about effective teaching, and practice some aspects of secondary teaching.",

How can attending to the role of practice alter our understanding of how knowledge is produced across scientific and religious worlds? What is a world, and who gets to define it? How might a new contract between science and religion reveal fresh possibilities for an ethical response to late capitalism: addressing historic exclusions, structural inequalities, and human-nonhuman relations? Readings may include: Bruno Latour, Donna Haraway, Kim TallBear, Anna Tsing, Isabell Stengers, Cathy Gere, Mary-Jane Rubenstein, Karen Barad, Robert Bellah, Gabriel Marcel, Elizabeth Povinelli, Nadia Abu El-Haj, Aicha Beliso-De Jesus, Marilyn Strathern, Catherine Keller, Abou Farman, Webb Keane.",

        "course_id": 210124775,
        "description": "Children across America spend roughly 12,000 hours in school from kindergarten through grade 12. How those instructional hours are spent dramatically impacts students’ academic and personal well-being. Many studies have demonstrated that teacher quality matters to students’ long-term outcomes including graduation and job placement. In this course, we delve into the essential principles of being an effective teacher, focusing specifically on the U.S. secondary classroom. Building community, designing culturally sustaining curriculum, teaching inclusively, and assessing students authentically are a handful of the principles we explore together through articles about teacher practice, video examples of classroom practice, and students opportunity to enact some of these practices during class. Each student is paired with a current secondary public school teacher across America to engage in a case study of effective teaching throughout the seminar. By the end of this course, you learn some core principles of effective teaching, gain an understanding of the complexities of enacting effective teaching practices given educational inequities, conduct a case study about effective teaching, and practice some aspects of secondary teaching.",

        "description": "In 1991, the arts organizations Visual AIDS and The Kitchen collaborated with video artist and filmmaker Charles Atlas to produce the live television broadcast \"We Interrupt this Program.\" Part educational presentation, part performance piece, the show was aired in millions of homes across the nation. The program, in The Kitchen’s words, \"sought to feature voices that had often been marginalized within many discussions of AIDS, in particular people of color and women.\"This course builds upon and is inspired by this aspect of Atlas's visionary presentation, an aspect that used the show to produce a critically multicultural platform that could activate cultural histories and critical traditions from various communities. In effect, the course uses this aspect as a metonym for the racial, gender, sexual, and class heterogeneity of queer art and organizing. It conducts its investigation by looking at a variety of primary materials that illustrate the heterogeneous makeup of queer and trans politics. The course also draws on more recent texts and visual works that arose from the earlier contexts that the primary texts helped to illuminate and shape.",

Green building seeks to minimize environmental impacts, strengthen the fabric of our cities and towns, and make our work and home lives more productive and fulfilling. This course is an applied course, exploring both the technical and the social-business-political aspects of buildings. Topics range from building science (hygrothermal performance of building enclosures) to indoor environmental quality; from product certifications to resilience (robust buildings and communities in the face of disasters and extended service outages). The purpose of this course is to build a solid background in the processes and issues related to green buildings, equipping students with practical knowledge about the built environment. Extensive use is made of resources from BuildingGreen, Inc., one of the leading information companies supporting green building and green building professionals. The course is primarily a lecture-discussion one with some fieldwork, substantial emphasis on research and group project work, and online individual testing. The course is strengthened by several guest lectures by leading green building professionals from across the country and across many disciplines: from architecture to material science, from engineering to green building business. The class meets once a week, with the instructor available to students during that same day. Enrollment limited to twenty-four.",

There are only two plots in all of literature, claimed the late John Gardner: the story of a journey, and of a stranger coming to town. Most travel literature is both: the story of a journey as well as a tale of a stranger, stepping into an alien land. This course examines a wide range of place-based literature, from long-form city portraits to travel memoir excerpts. Readings by writers such as Ryszard Kapuscinski, Jan Morris, Leslie Jamison, and Pico Iyer will acquaint students with the techniques by which journalists and writers capture the essential qualities of a place. All instruction is in English. Enrollment limited. Application deadline: February 15. Students are responsible for arranging travel to and from France and all other program expenses beyond tuition.

To this end, we have broken the course into two main units. In the first, \"Mediating Fears,\" we analyze how fear has historically circulated and how media have conveyed and transformed this emotion. In the second, \"Fearing Media,\" we look at media as objects of fear, due their nature as technological, modern, ephemeral, unfamiliar, attractive, and pervasive objects. In order to better explore fear as a concept and as an object of experience, every week we present a theoretical framework (first meeting) and a case study (second meeting). Readings include academic papers, literary works, op-eds, and articles in both print and digital publications",

This corpus includes poetry, narratives, folktales, philosophical texts and chivalric romance. From magical herbs to men dressed in women’s clothing, these entertaining stories challenge our perceptions of medieval Jewish culture as a place only of religious observance and rabbinic stringency. In these stories, \"love\" appears in various forms with some repeating characteristics, such as the objectification of the female body, a woman’s duplicity, or the happy marriage between two suitable partners. Men are alternatively the victims and the perpetrators of horrific acts done in the name of love. Through a close reading of these texts in English translation, students learn to understand the complexities of love, marriage, and romance in medieval Jewish literary culture. No previous knowledge of Judaism, Hebrew, or medieval literature is expected.",

        "title": "Love and Romance in Medieval Jewish Culture",
        "course_id": 200315230,
        "description": "This course explores the fascinating body of love stories and romance in medieval Jewish culture, written mostly between the tenth and fourteenth centuries across the Mediterranean basin and Christian Europe. This corpus includes poetry, narratives, folktales, philosophical texts and chivalric romance. From magical herbs to men dressed in women’s clothing, these entertaining stories challenge our perceptions of medieval Jewish culture as a place only of religious observance and rabbinic stringency. In these stories, \"love\" appears in various forms with some repeating characteristics, such as the objectification of the female body, a woman’s duplicity, or the happy marriage between two suitable partners. Men are alternatively the victims and the perpetrators of horrific acts done in the name of love. Through a close reading of these texts in English translation, students learn to understand the complexities of love, marriage, and romance in medieval Jewish literary culture. No previous knowledge of Judaism, Hebrew, or medieval literature is expected.",

Though the term was coined in 1688 as a medical diagnosis for homesickness, it has since come to fundamentally shape the way that we imagine our past, present, and future. Often described as a longing for a different time or a simpler past, nostalgia has inspired artists, authors, composers, filmmakers, and thinkers to create masterpieces of longing and imagined worlds. In the realm of politics, on the other hand, nationalist parties have harnessed the sentiment to commit acts of extreme violence. Many contemporary thinkers have classified modern nostalgia as an epidemic to be feared or avoided at all costs. Today, we are witnessing the intensification of politics of nostalgia, which itself has a long history. This course explores that history, and asks the question: if we are all already nostalgic, how can we use our nostalgia for productive, rather than destructive, ends? We consider many facets of nostalgia, both positive and negative, including its close connection with memory, desire, identity, the nation, and even the modern categories of time and space.",

For some, the university has always upheld the interests of traditional elites, privilege and inequality; for others, it should be a transformative institution for overcoming social ills and divisions of class, race, religion, and gender. Beginning with classic nineteenth-century writers including Tocqueville, Arnold, Newman, and Hardy on education and cultural aspiration, the course examines major twentieth-century exponents of the bildungsroman, künstlerroman, and campus novel forms, including distinguished works by Forster, Joyce, Woolf, Waugh, Mary McCarthy, Du Bois, Gandhi, Fanon, Tayib Salih, and J. M. Coetzee, and then concludes with notable twenty-first century works on this subject by Zadie Smith, Jeffrey Eugenides, and Sally Rooney.",

Our main textbook is The Visual Display of Quantitative Information by Edward Tufte, a foundational book that explores the history of data visualization and offers a perspective on how graphs should be constructed. We also learn from other visualization pioneers not included in Tufte's review such as W.E.B. Du Bois and Florence Nightingale. Our secondary textbook is the ggplot2 book by Hadley Wickham, an indispensable resource for constructing statistical graphs in the programming language R. The main goal of the course is to help students to communicate both \"what we know and why we think we know it\" through excellent data visualization.",

Domestically, martial arts films have served to promote the nation, while on the international arena, they have been one of the primary conduits of transnational cinematic interaction, as kung-fu or samurai films have influenced films inside and outside East Asia, from The Matrix to Kill Bill. Martial arts cinema has become a crucial means for thinking through such issues as nation, ethnicity, history, East vs. West, the body, gender, sexuality, stardom, industry, spirituality, philosophy, and mediality, from modernity to postmodernity. It is thus not surprising that martial arts films have also attracted some of the world’s best filmmakers, ranging from Kurosawa Akira to Wong Kar Wai. This course focuses on films from Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea—as well as on works from other countries influenced by them—covering such martial arts genres such as the samurai film, kung-fu, karate, wuxia, and related historical epics. It provides a historical survey of each nation and genre, while connecting them to other genres, countries, and media.",

We read works by a wide range of literary and political thinkers from the last two-and-a-half centuries or so, reflecting especially on questions such as: What is the relationship between literature and politics? How does social change play out in literature, and, in turn, what role might literature play in social change? Where does the category of the ‘literary’ come from, and how does it relate to key political categories such as ‘the people’? How might literature—and the arts generally—be of use to us in our attempts to create a more just, free, and equal society? How might a more just, free, and equal society allow us to relate to literature and the arts? On the literary side, our writers may include William Wordsworth, Jane Austen, W.B. Yeats, Virginia Woolf, Federico Garcia Lorca, Pablo Neruda, Czeslaw Milosz, Wislawa Szymborska, Audre Lorde, Seamus Heaney, Milan Kundera.  On the political side, our thinkers may include Edmund Burke, Mary Wollstonecraft, J.S. Mill, Karl Marx, Karl Popper, Immanuel Wallerstein.",

Instead of focusing on the biography of a single drug, or class of drugs, this course incorporates a wide range of substances, including alcohol, cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, psychedelics, and narcotics. Through a selection of essays, book chapters, and primary source material, we discuss how certain ways of using and selling drugs have been sanctioned and encouraged, while others have been pathologized as addiction or criminalized. We explore how drug definitions are constructed, how they shift over time, and how they reflect, reinforce, and sometimes challenge anxieties about race, disability, sexuality, and gender. Throughout the course, films, images, music, and television episodes are also presented as objects of analysis to provide insight into the cultural lives of drugs. We explore how historians approach this subject, assess their sources and assumptions, and consider the choices they have made in researching and writing. Students are expected to apply these historical lessons to the present and demonstrate the ability to think and write critically about the history of drugs.",

Instead of focusing on the biography of a single drug, or class of drugs, this course incorporates a wide range of substances, including alcohol, cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, psychedelics, and narcotics.

Domestically, martial arts films have served to promote the nation, while on the international arena, they have been one of the primary conduits of transnational cinematic interaction, as kung-fu or samurai films have influenced films inside and outside East Asia, from The Matrix to Kill Bill. Martial arts cinema has become a crucial means for thinking through such issues as nation, ethnicity, history, East vs. West, the body, gender, sexuality, stardom, industry, spirituality, philosophy, and mediality, from modernity to postmodernity. It is thus not surprising that martial arts films have also attracted some of the world’s best filmmakers, ranging from Kurosawa Akira to Wong Kar Wai. This course focuses on films from Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea—as well as on works from other countries influenced by them—covering such martial arts genres such as the samurai film, kung-fu, karate, wuxia, and related historical epics. It provides a historical survey of each nation and genre, while connecting them to other genres, countries, and media.",

        "description": "Is health care a human right? Can health advocacy shape health policy? What does it mean to be a health \"activist\" and to demand change of medicine? Health care in America has always been political. In this seminar students explore the rich history of health activism and health advocacy in the modern United States, focusing primarily on the postwar period through the present day. Each week we encounter new varieties of grassroots organizing, individual activists, and advocacy organizations that have made political claims about health care and pushed for its reform. We examine how health activism shapes broader cultural conversations about health and the practice of medicine itself. This course does not aim to provide a comprehensive history of health activism in modern America, but rather takes a case study approach, for critical analysis of themes and tactics. For each session, students read a selection of essays, book chapters, or primary source materials about a particular variety of health activism. Through these readings, we discuss how the critiques of activists and the responses by medical practitioners reveal the significant impact of race, gender, class, and sexuality on the provision of health care in this country. We also consider how historians have approached this subject, both as scholars and participant-observers. Students become adept at primary source analysis and able to engage in scholarly conversations with secondary sources.",

        "description": "Virtually every American today \"does\" drugs. As a nation, our drug use ranges from everyday activities, such as drinking coffee or beer, to combating illnesses with prescription medications, to using illegal drugs for recreation. This course follow a loose chronology beginning in the early twentieth century and ending in the present day. Instead of focusing on the biography of a single drug, or class of drugs, this course incorporates a wide range of substances, including alcohol, cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, psychedelics, and narcotics. Through a selection of essays, book chapters, and primary source material, we discuss how certain ways of using and selling drugs have been sanctioned and encouraged, while others have been pathologized as addiction or criminalized. We explore how drug definitions are constructed, how they shift over time, and how they reflect, reinforce, and sometimes challenge anxieties about race, disability, sexuality, and gender. Throughout the course, films, images, music, and television episodes are also presented as objects of analysis to provide insight into the cultural lives of drugs. We explore how historians approach this subject, assess their sources and assumptions, and consider the choices they have made in researching and writing. Students are expected to apply these historical lessons to the present and demonstrate the ability to think and write critically about the history of drugs.",

        "description": "Is health care a human right? Can health advocacy shape health policy? What does it mean to be a health \"activist\" and to demand change of medicine? Health care in America has always been political. In this seminar students explore the rich history of health activism and health advocacy in the modern United States, focusing primarily on the postwar period through the present day. Each week we encounter new varieties of grassroots organizing, individual activists, and advocacy organizations that have made political claims about health care and pushed for its reform. We examine how health activism shapes broader cultural conversations about health and the practice of medicine itself. This course does not aim to provide a comprehensive history of health activism in modern America, but rather takes a case study approach, for critical analysis of themes and tactics. For each session, students read a selection of essays, book chapters, or primary source materials about a particular variety of health activism. Through these readings, we discuss how the critiques of activists and the responses by medical practitioners reveal the significant impact of race, gender, class, and sexuality on the provision of health care in this country. We also consider how historians have approached this subject, both as scholars and participant-observers. Students become adept at primary source analysis and able to engage in scholarly conversations with secondary sources.",

The idea of ‘autofiction,’ defined by Serge Doubrovsky as \"fiction based on strictly real events and facts\" in 1977, has steadily gained in significance, and well beyond France. The term ‘autotheory’ began to trend, in the United States, with Maggie Nelson’s The Argonauts (2015)—but older texts, such as Chris Kraus’s I Love Dick, can likewise be read as autotheory. While autofiction has, at least in the beginning, been more associated with class, autotheory’s blend of autobiography and memoir with theory and philosophy has heavily drawn from—and informed—feminist and queer theory as well as postcolonial studies. In the course, we discuss autofictional and autotheoretical writings from a variety of cultures and contexts, seeking to better understand how they function as art, critique, and resistance. Readings include Annie Ernaux, bell hooks, Chris Kraus, Karl Ove Knausgård, Paul B. Preciado, Maggie Nelson, Saša Stanišić, Deniz Ohde, and Jia Tolentino.",

Key texts by Jessie Fauset, Nella Larsen, Jean Toomer, and Eric Walrond are central, along with lesser-known works by Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes. We consider critical debates about these texts and their standard designation as part of the \"Harlem Renaissance.\" Careful close reading is emphasized throughout; students are guided through a process of archival research and sustained formal analysis to produce a polished critical essay.",

Our readings track circuits of knowledge from anthropology and philosophy to geological history, literary criticism, and environmental studies as we come to terms with the loss of biodiversity, impending wildlife extinctions, and political-economic havoc wrought by global warming associated with the Anthropocene.  A persistent provocation guides our inquiry: What multispecies worldings become possible to recognize and cultivate when we dare to decenter the human in our politics, passions, and aspirations for life on a shared planet?",

After defining terms and exploring the ways that infrastructure has been conceptualized and studied, we analyze how different types of infrastructure (energy, roads, people, and so on) constitute the material and social world of empire. At the same time, infrastructure is not an uncontested arena: it often serves as a key site of political struggle or even enters the fray as an unruly actor itself, thus conditioning possibilities for anti-imperial and decolonial practice. The geographic focus of this course is the African continent, but we explore comparative cases in other regions of the majority and minority world.",

Departing from the notion of \"techne\" as craftsmanship or art, we consider the ways in which the history of art is always informed by histories of technology; and that histories of technology are often advanced through practices of art making. Topics include technologies for representing space in European and Asian painting and the centrality of Arab science in the development of linear perspective during the Renaissance; histories of textiles as data storage before the advent of the computer; the cybernetic revolution and the rise of computers; biometrics and surveillance; machine learning and art without artists. Objects include textiles, sculpture, painting, prints, photography and video, as well as sound, digital platforms and AI-generated artifacts. The course aims to de-center triumphal and universalist notions of technological achievement and ideologies of \"progress\" that inform contemporary cultures of media and technology. We pay special attention to the interests of race and gender throughout the semester. This course is open to all, including those with no prior background in art history. Sections may include visits to collections and sites across Yale campus.",

Youth require special protections of their rights due to vulnerabilities related to their physical and mental immaturity. These rights include, not only protections, but opportunities for building the cognitive, emotional, and social skills necessary for becoming a healthy adult and a contributing member of society. This seminar examines the extent to which legal policies and practices in the treatment of youths are consistent with scientific knowledge on psychological and brain development. Each class discusses one or more legal cases highlighted in the context of brain and psychological science and current laws and policies.",

Why are we not just mindless robots, that produce behavior in light of stimulations from the environment, but lack any inner awareness or consciousness?

        "description": "Children across America spend roughly 12,000 hours in school from kindergarten through grade 12. How those instructional hours are spent dramatically impacts students’ academic and personal well-being. Many studies have demonstrated that teacher quality matters to students’ long-term outcomes including graduation and job placement. In this course, we delve into the essential principles of being an effective teacher, focusing specifically on the U.S. secondary classroom. Building community, designing culturally sustaining curriculum, teaching inclusively, and assessing students authentically are a handful of the principles we explore together through articles about teacher practice, video examples of classroom practice, and students opportunity to enact some of these practices during class. Each student is paired with a current secondary public school teacher across America to engage in a case study of effective teaching throughout the seminar. By the end of this course, you learn some core principles of effective teaching, gain an understanding of the complexities of enacting effective teaching practices given educational inequities, conduct a case study about effective teaching, and practice some aspects of secondary teaching.",

In this course, we delve into the essential principles of being an effective teacher, focusing specifically on the U.S. secondary classroom. Building community, designing culturally sustaining curriculum, teaching inclusively, and assessing students authentically are a handful of the principles we explore together through articles about teacher practice, video examples of classroom practice, and students opportunity to enact some of these practices during class. Each student is paired with a current secondary public school teacher across America to engage in a case study of effective teaching throughout the seminar. By the end of this course, you learn some core principles of effective teaching, gain an understanding of the complexities of enacting effective teaching practices given educational inequities, conduct a case study about effective teaching, and practice some aspects of secondary teaching.",

We also cover domain-specific hardware (e.g., graphics processing units), and ongoing industry efforts to elevate them to the status of first-class computing units. In tandem, we cover topics relevant to both general-purpose and domain-specific computing, including memory hierarchies, address translation and virtual memory, on-chip networks, machine learning techniques for resource management, and coherence techniques. If time permits, we will study the basics of emerging non-classical computing paradigms like neuromorphic computing. Overall, this course offers insights on how the computing industry is combating the waning of traditional technology scaling via acceleration and heterogeneity.",

        "description": "The 19th century was an age of secularism, rationality, industrialization, urbanization, and scientific and technological innovation—but it was also marked by a popular obsession with the paranormal. People from all walks of life held séances, summoned ghostly apparitions, and performed magic rituals. Why did this interest in the occult persist in the rational modern word? Exploring this paradox, this course focuses on Britain, with occasional forays across the ocean to America. Using a wide variety of fascinating sources like spirit photographs, séance transcripts, and documents in the Yale archives, we examine the origins, spread, and significance of our modern fascination with the \"other world.\"",

        "description": "The world of the seventeenth-century Netherlands was at once small and vast, tempered and violent. This course surveys the history of Dutch art across media with a focus on the internal contradictions of a nation that called itself a 'republic' but often acted as an empire, that encouraged women’s education but confined women to the home, that both coveted luxuries from abroad and condemned those who reveled in them. Some of the period’s most famous artists, including Rembrandt and Vermeer, scarcely traveled beyond the confines of the province of Holland, while Dutch ships traversed the globe in pursuit of trade, discoveries, and conquest. Innovations in everything from microscopy to urban infrastructure were pursued against the backdrop of debates about freedom, religion, and the place of humankind in the cosmos. To reconcile the many overlapping realms of art and culture in what was long called, without scrutiny, the Dutch ‘Golden Age’ is an impossible task. To study them is to confront the origins of the many contradictory worlds we inhabit today. This course makes ample use of Yale Collections and is open to all, including those with no prior background in art history.",

It follows a broad definition of media as material apparatuses that record, transmit, and process the world. Steam, photography, telegraphy, sound-recording, and cinema were only some of the ways people found their worlds disrupted, both excitingly and distressingly. Literature is, of course, itself a medium, and as a first-rate archive of media history it serves as our chief, but not exclusive, entry-point. Readings include works of literature, recent scholarship, and primary documents or artifacts from the arts and sciences. We may look at paintings, pianos, and weather reports as well as telegrams, photographs, and séances. We work within a long nineteenth century (1789-1914) though mostly focus on the 1830s to 1890s. Our geographical center of gravity is the the UK and US, with occasional side trips to the continent. Questions of empire of course take us elsewhere, and final essays on areas beyond the Anglophone world are welcome.",

It follows a broad definition of media as material apparatuses that record, transmit, and process the world. Steam, photography, telegraphy, sound-recording, and cinema were only some of the ways people found their worlds disrupted, both excitingly and distressingly. Literature is, of course, itself a medium, and as a first-rate archive of media history it serves as our chief, but not exclusive, entry-point. Readings include works of literature, recent scholarship, and primary documents or artifacts from the arts and sciences. We may look at paintings, pianos, and weather reports as well as telegrams, photographs, and séances. We work within a long nineteenth century (1789-1914) though mostly focus on the 1830s to 1890s. Our geographical center of gravity is the the UK and US, with occasional side trips to the continent. Questions of empire of course take us elsewhere, and final essays on areas beyond the Anglophone world are welcome.",

This course surveys the history of Dutch art across media with a focus on the internal contradictions of a nation that called itself a 'republic' but often acted as an empire, that encouraged women’s education but confined women to the home, that both coveted luxuries from abroad and condemned those who reveled in them. Some of the period’s most famous artists, including Rembrandt and Vermeer, scarcely traveled beyond the confines of the province of Holland, while Dutch ships traversed the globe in pursuit of trade, discoveries, and conquest. Innovations in everything from microscopy to urban infrastructure were pursued against the backdrop of debates about freedom, religion, and the place of humankind in the cosmos. To reconcile the many overlapping realms of art and culture in what was long called, without scrutiny, the Dutch ‘Golden Age’ is an impossible task. To study them is to confront the origins of the many contradictory worlds we inhabit today. This course makes ample use of Yale Collections and is open to all, including those with no prior background in art history.",

Reading the novel closely, we pose the following questions. In what ways is this patriotic war epic also an imperial novel? What myths does it destroy and construct? How does it combine fiction and history? What forces drive history, as it unfolds in the present? What are the limits of individual agency, and how much do emperors and generals control the fates of nations and armies? Finally, a question that is never too broad for Tolstoy: what is a meaningful, well-lived life? We explore these questions while refining our tools of literary analysis and situating the novel in its historical context and in our contemporary world.

The course explores the expression in these works of philosophical stances of their times on the human subject and human society, bringing to bear writings contemporary to them as well as from more recent times. Readings include works of Ficino, Descartes, Rousseau, Wollstonecraft, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Douglass, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, and Adorno. We discover that the expression of changing philosophical stances can be found not only in dramatic themes and the words sung, but in the changing natures of the musical styles deployed.",

In select fiction and poetry spanning a variety of cultures and times, we look at the aesthetic challenges of conveying music in words; in select music from the same periods, we study the use of literary themes and narrative. How does music inhabit literature, and literature influence music? We read fiction describing music and borrowing musical forms; we study symphonies and opera inspired by literature; we look at films that bring together these two arts. Students examine theoretical approaches and learn comparative methods useful for literature and culture courses. Though not required, musical experience and/or interest is welcomed for the seminar, which may be taken simultaneously with gateway courses in the humanities. Enrollment limited to first-year students.

        "description": "Twenty-first century societies are faced with both threats and opportunities that combine sophisticated computation with politics and international relations in critical ways.  Examples include cyber warfare; cyber espionage; cyber crime; the role of social media in democratic self-governance, authoritarian control, and election \"hacking\"; cryptocurrencies; and mass surveillance.  This course examines the political challenges wrought by massive increases in the power of computational and communication technologies and the potential for citizens and governments to harness those technologies to solve problems.  It is co-taught by one faculty member in computer science and one in political science.  Programming experience and some knowledge of basic computer science is required. Meets with CPSC 210/PLSC 369. Students may earn credit for CPSC 210/PLSC 369 or for CPSC 310; not for both.",

Although The Game of Thrones is obviously not a work of German literature, it addresses theoretical and literary-historical discourses that are prominently represented in the German context. Emphasis on strategies of literary and theoretical analysis; literature as a testing ground for theoretical models; theory as an analytic framework for evaluating literary and cultural depictions. Questioning the basis of the contemporary relevance and popularity of this material in light of questions of tragedy, individual agency, myth (vs. history), realism (vs. fantasy), environmental catastrophe and geopolitics.",

Topics include computational modelling of speech movements, the resulting speech signal, human speech perception behavior, as well as relevant computational tools for signal processing, feature extraction, and machine learning.",

Elsewhere nationalist archaeology has been used to bolster nationalism and facilitate state building. Africans, while embracing their recent history, have a marked disconnect to the cradle paradigm. A paradox thus arises out of the fact that the cradle of humanity status of Africa appears to hold no special place in the psyche of most of its inhabitants. This course examines symbolism, colonialism, poverty, media, literacy, and religion as agencies that distance the ‘humanity cradle’ status of Africa from nationalist and identity discourses.",

        "description": "Ever since the establishment of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in 1948 and the Korean War (1950–1953), North Korea has been depicted by the media as a reclusive, oppressive, and military country, its leaders as the worst dictators, and its people as brainwashed, tortured, and starving to death. The still ongoing Cold War discourse, intensified by the North Korea’s recent secret nuclear weapons program, furthers these negative images, and outsiders have passively internalized these images. However, these simplistic characterizations prevent one from gaining a balanced understanding of and insight into North Korea and its people on the ground. Topics other than political, military, and security issues are rarely given attention. On the whole, even though North Korea’s land area is larger than South Korea and its population of 25 million accounts for a third of all Koreans, North Korea has been neglected in the scholarly discussion of Korean culture. This class tries to make sense of North Korea in a more comprehensive way by integrating the political and economic with social, cultural, and religious dimensions. In order to accomplish this objective, students examine leadership, religious (especially cultic) aspects of the North Korean Juche ideology, the daily lives of its citizens, religious traditions, the Korean War, nuclear development and missiles, North Korean defectors and refugees, human rights, Christian missionary organizations, and unification, among others. Throughout, the course places North Korean issues in the East Asian and global context. The course draws upon recent scholarly books, articles, journals, interviews with North Korean defectors, travelogues, media publications, and visual materials.",

This research seminar examines the diverse forms of environmental thought and activism that have emerged from the global South—drawing examples from Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America—since the early twentieth century. The course examines: the environmental legacies of colonialism, the role of ecology in anticolonial movements, early articulations of environmental justice in the 1970s, the role of violence and repression in state responses to environmental activism, the rise of increasingly networked environmental movements from the Global South that made themselves heard at the Rio Earth Summit of 1992—which took place 30 years ago, and the moral and political histories that underpin the negotiating stance of countries of the Global South in climate change negotiations. This class makes extensive use of primary sources, including material from the Yale collections and it straddles the boundaries between environmental, intellectual, and political history.",

The class takes a long view, starting with the sources of internal migration in the late 19th and early 20th century before moving on to an examination of migration north to the United States. It deals with topics related to U.S. military interventions, civil wars, political repression, economic policies, Cold War politics, labor, family relations. During the second half of the semester, we deal with the post-Cold War period and triangulate between the economic restructuring of North America, the militarization of the border and immigration policy, and the escalating war on drugs and cartel violence.",

What are an individual’s rights and responsibilities in the face of illness, and how do public health organizations prioritize competing claims? How should issues of consent, quarantine, compulsory treatment, and surveillance be managed, and how do these issues change as they transcend geographic borders? This seminar examines critical issues in global health through the method of ethical analysis. The course begins with the foundations for analyzing ethical problems, considering moral and ethical frameworks for health. We examine dilemmas such as quarantines, access to care, and the limits of autonomy, and we delve into critical challenges of vulnerable populations and global inequities. We conclude by analyzing emerging tensions posed by artificial intelligence and digital health technologies. Drawing together global health perspectives and ethical analysis, we consider the principles, tradeoffs, and central tensions that inform global health today.",

        "description": "Most histories of the environmental movement still privilege the American and European experience. This research seminar examines the diverse forms of environmental thought and activism that have emerged from the global South—drawing examples from Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America—since the early twentieth century. The course examines: the environmental legacies of colonialism, the role of ecology in anticolonial movements, early articulations of environmental justice in the 1970s, the role of violence and repression in state responses to environmental activism, the rise of increasingly networked environmental movements from the Global South that made themselves heard at the Rio Earth Summit of 1992—which took place 30 years ago, and the moral and political histories that underpin the negotiating stance of countries of the Global South in climate change negotiations. This class makes extensive use of primary sources, including material from the Yale collections and it straddles the boundaries between environmental, intellectual, and political history.",

        "description": "Both the ideology and practices of Nazi Germany rank among the most insidious the world has ever seen. For this reason, this historical era has generated, simultaneously, immense revulsion and immense fascination among scholars. They have attempted to explain how such a regime could emerge, how its citizens could come to support it, how it could carry out atrocities with such scale and brutality, and how Germany could rebuild itself after such physical and ideological violence. In this course, we join these scholars in trying to understand Nazi Germany. Together, we chart the rise and fall of National Socialism in Germany from the early twentieth century through the decades after the end of the Second World War. Via a collection of both primary and secondary source literature, we confront some of the most contentious debates in this field of study: what made Nazism so popular among ordinary Germans? How do we interpret Hitler’s role in its development? Was German violence toward Jews and other groups slated for murder a product of deep-seated antisemitism and xenophobia or did it evolve organically over the course of the Nazi period? Did the Holocaust form from the top down as the product of a small collection of people driven by the demands of the Führer, or from the bottom up as a function of shifting circumstances like the trajectory of the Second World War? How can we understand the emergence of camps and killing fields? How do we make sense of the complicated registers of German guilt for the events of the Nazi period? Is it useful (or appropriate) to compare the Holocaust to other genocides? This course exposes students to the range of answers that responsible and meticulous historical research has offered to these questions. There are, however, mountains of literature that have been written on the rise, lifespan, and fall of National Socialism. This course can only begin to chip away modestly at that mass. Nevertheless, the goal is that, by the end of the semester, students develop a sense of the outlines of the major historiographical debates about this period and give thought to the ways that those debates remain relevant to our contemporary world.",

The class takes a long view, starting with the sources of internal migration in the late 19th and early 20th century before moving on to an examination of migration north to the United States. It deals with topics related to U.S. military interventions, civil wars, political repression, economic policies, Cold War politics, labor, family relations. During the second half of the semester, we deal with the post-Cold War period and triangulate between the economic restructuring of North America, the militarization of the border and immigration policy, and the escalating war on drugs and cartel violence.",

        "course_id": 220311872,
        "description": "This course pairs two interconnected phenomena: the rise of the Indian Republic and the birth of the postcolonial novel. Over the course of the semester, we read a single primary text: Vikram Seth’s A Suitable Boy (1993). Set in the 1950s in the aftermath of India’s Independence and Partition, Seth’s encyclopaedic novel is the story of four families brought together by a mother’s search for a \"suitable boy\" for her daughter to marry. In the process, it builds a microcosm of an Indian society coming to terms with postcolonial statehood and weighing the aftereffects of British colonialism. Entwined in its plot about marriage, love, and relationships are some of the most urgent cultural and political concerns facing the new nation: legislative changes and land reforms, the violent aftermath of the Partition, secularism tainted by communal tensions, the disintegration of courtly forms of sociality, the reconstruction of city life, and the fate of the English novel in the postcolonial classroom. We read A Suitable Boy as literary critics and historians, pairing close readings of language and literary form with historical scholarship. Over the course of our discussions, we address the following questions: what is the relationship between the nation, the novel, and identity in the postcolonial world? How do we read narratives of \"nation building\" as literary and cultural constructions? What do we make of \"literature\" and \"history\" as disciplinary categories and formations? The seminar introduces students to methods of literary criticism and textual studies, and teaches them how to read a range of primary sources, from legislative debates, bureaucratic reports, newspapers, poetry, cinema, and radio.",

What are an individual’s rights and responsibilities in the face of illness, and how do public health organizations prioritize competing claims? How should issues of consent, quarantine, compulsory treatment, and surveillance be managed, and how do these issues change as they transcend geographic borders? This seminar examines critical issues in global health through the method of ethical analysis. The course begins with the foundations for analyzing ethical problems, considering moral and ethical frameworks for health. We examine dilemmas such as quarantines, access to care, and the limits of autonomy, and we delve into critical challenges of vulnerable populations and global inequities. We conclude by analyzing emerging tensions posed by artificial intelligence and digital health technologies. Drawing together global health perspectives and ethical analysis, we consider the principles, tradeoffs, and central tensions that inform global health today.",

And it’s two nicknames, \"The Magic City\" and \"Gateway to Lain America,\" seem to obfuscate the city more than more than reveal it, suggesting mystery and transnationalism, a space that \"magically\" appeared and exists on the cusp of the United States and Latin America. Seeking to historicize these popular notions and cultural products of Miami, this course charts Miami’s cultural, political, and racial history from incorporation in 1896 through present day, tracing the city’s evolution from a Jim Crow city to twenty-first century \"Latin metropolis.\" Dispelling myths that Cuban exiles \"created\" Miami after the triumph of the Cuban revolution in 1959, we assess Miami’s construction as a particular racial, sexual, and ethnic space in the first half of the twentieth century. Then, we historicize how Cuban immigration transformed the city and its political landscape—in conjunction with other immigrant populations. Throughout the course, we consider Miami’s role in U.S. politics and popular imagination.",

        "description": "The focus of this course is gay, lesbian, and queer writing from the period between Whitman and Stonewall. How did queer writers find an audience in the years before the emergence of a gay/lesbian public? What languages of identity and sexuality did they develop? The course begins with Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, writing before the idea of sexual minorities took hold. We read some late 19C writers in their wake, including Charles Warren Stoddard, and the literary culture of the \"Boston marriage,\" before turning to the conjunction of sexual culture and modernism. Queer modernism has been much studied in recent years, including such figures as Wilde, Freud, Joyce, Woolf, Stein, Barnes, Firbank, Crane, Thurman, Hughes, and Proust; in the same years, a language of homosexual rights began to develop with such works as Imre, by Edward Prime Stevenson. Many of the writers in the period explored unsettled sexualities and worlds of abjection, in ways that can still disturb readers. They influenced one another across the Atlantic and across genres. We touch on the British and Irish writers who came of age after WWI (Isherwood, Auden, Spender, Ackerley, Barnes), as well as the paradigmatically queer writing of those for whom queerness was linked to a language of criminality—notably Jean Genet, Patricia Highsmith, and William Burroughs. Students are encouraged to pursue research projects in each of these moments, reaching up to the Beats (Burroughs, Ginsberg, Kerouac), the New York poets (O’Hara, Ashbery, Schuyler) the San Francisco Renaissance (Spicer, Duncan, Broughton), Southern queer writers (McCullers, Capote, Williams), black queer writing after the Harlem Renaissance (Baldwin, Hansberry), and other figures of the 60s from both high literary and underground backgrounds (Nabokov, Elizabeth Bishop, Joe Orton, and Vidal, but also Jack Smith, Jane Rule, and Iceberg Slim). Along the way we talk about the various ways that these writers charted a queer take on the world, including their engagements with criminality and psychopathology—the main connotations of queerness in the period—as well as the development of a queer language of abjection and its advantages for life. Students are encouraged to delve into the rich holdings of the Beinecke for research projects not limited to the writers on the syllabus, including the lesbian pulp fiction collection and holdings in the related fields of photography, film, and other arts.",

We begin with an overview of core concepts in the study of inequality and mobility including measurement and recent trends. We then proceed by examining the role of institutions—including the family, schools, neighborhoods, labor markets, and the criminal justice system—in mitigating, maintaining, or reproducing inequalities within and between groups. We also critically evaluate public policy proposals aimed at reducing inequality and promoting economic mobility.",

They could have been among the first to swear allegiance to one (or several) of 130 new states, almost twice the number that existed in 1900. They would have been certain to witness massive ecological destruction, as well as unparalleled advances in medicine, science, and the arts. The twentieth century was, as one historian puts it, an age of extremes, and in this class we explore some of these aspects of the age. The class is not intended to be a complete history nor is it one that provides an integrative interpretation of historical events. The aim is rather to enable students to know enough to think for themselves about the origins of today’s world and about how historical change is created.",

        "description": "Less than a century old, television is one of the youngest but most influential mediums to shape politics, pop culture, and American society. For years, scholars, critics, and fans looked back at the sitcoms and dramas made between 1947-1960 as representative of a \"Golden Age of Television\" that engaged with a changing society that followed the trauma of World War II. Decades later, in the early 2000s, premium cable shows like The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, and Oz suggested that a new Golden Age of Television had arrived. This course pairs these two eras of television to ask: Are there similarities between these two eras of television? How do these stories, represented visually on television, relate to the world outside of the screen? How has the rise of streaming reconfigured our viewing habits and the ways that we understand the world? By looking at two eras of television we work to see what some of the major tropes or threads are, and understand how certain shows that are considered a part of either \"Golden Age of Television\" create meaning and interest in viewers. Programs include: I Love Lucy, Roots, The Twilight Zone, The Wire, Deadwood, and How to Get Away with Murder.",

The course is anchored around six trans-historical models of thinking about selfhood: the ideal self, the lover, the revolutionary, the convert, the solipsist, and the social climber. We range widely across genres, media, periods, and geographies: from Plato's Symposium to Machado de Assis's Epitaph for a Small Winner, from the ghazals of Hafez to the Kamasutra. We also make extensive use of Yale's rich manuscript archives, historical object collections, and art galleries and devote sustained attention to improving students' academic writing skills. This is a 1.5 credit intensive writing course that fulfills one WR requirement. Friday sessions will alternate between writing workshops and field trips to Yale collections.",

        "description": "Food is an unusual issue for city governments and an everyday issue for people: we all have to eat. What we eat, where it is purchased, how it is prepared, the ways food is grown, processed, distributed, and how we dispose of it–these are all parts of the ‘food system’. This Urban Lab explores the food system through its many points of interaction with city government and the built environment. Engaging locally with food policy in and around New Haven, this Urban Lab embraces the illegible aspects of cities and resists looking at the city as a fixed concept. Rather, we approach the city as a site of ongoing processes–citymaking and policymaking as iterative, contested, and multi-sectoral practices playing out over generations and across political administrations. Beyond the local food system, we also look at global trends and Federal-level policies in food policy. The lab focuses on developing methods of relevance to the practice of urbanism, including site visits to develop a shared way of seeing, data gathering, documentation, and mapping with work critiqued collectively, and the use of non-academic documents.",

Many of the key challenges the world faces today have their origins in imperial structures and policies, from wars and terror to racism and environmental destruction. This seminar looks at the transformation empires and imperialisms went through from the middle part of the nineteenth century and up to today. Our discussions center on how and why imperialisms moved from strategies of territorial occupation and raw exploitation, the \"smash and grab\" version of empire, and on to policies of racial hierarchies, social control and reform, and colonial concepts of civilizational progress, many of which are still with us today. The seminar also covers anti-colonial resistance, revolutionary organizations and ideas, and processes of decolonization.",

        "description": "The seminar is designed to give a broad understanding of the lines of theorizing and types of research that animate the study of human rights issues and human rights mobilizations in post-soviet Russia. Acquainting students with academic research in history, sociology, anthropology and political science on the matter, the seminar seeks to analyze these topics going beyond media portrayals of Russian society and binary oppositions that often structure narratives of Post-soviet social and political reality (state vs. civil society, rule of law vs. kangaroo justice, democracy vs. authoritarianism, repression vs. resistance). This course analyzes how \"human rights\" have been constructed—as a cause, as a discourse, as a legal and institutional framework—since the Soviet dissident movement, then in the 1990s and 2000s, until today, when \"human rights\" have become a dominant frame on a number of very heterogenous issues for media and activists denouncing the political regime in Putin’s Russia. It pays particular attention to the sociology of actors, as well as to historical, political and social conditions of emergence and development of human rights mobilizations. The course also focuses on various empirical case studies on highly mediatized human rights issues: political prisoners, protest-related trials, women’s rights, LGBTQ rights, prison and penitentiary institutions. These case studies provide students with a broader empirical knowledge on contemporary Russian society, and serve as a magnifying glass, as they highlight complex dynamics of Russian politics and law in the last thirty years.",

Topics include ethics, political philosophy, epistemology, and ontology. We discuss the basic works of Confucian and Daoist philosophers during the Warring States and early imperial eras, the continuation of these traditions in early medieval \"dark learning,\" Buddhist philosophy (in its original Indian context, the early period of its spread to China, and in mature Chinese Buddhist schools such as Chan/Zen), and Neo-Confucian philosophy. The course emphasizes readings in the original texts of the thinkers and traditions in question (all in English translation). No knowledge of Chinese or previous contact with Chinese philosophy required.",

It has been used to define the nature and radical possibilities of indigeneity, anti-colonial nationalism, counter-cultural narratives, and capitalist critiques. At the same time, dress–and its social and legal regulation–also creates and reinforces social hierarchies, systems of morality, and forms of exclusion. This course centers these competing social realities and histories using clothing as a way into understanding the poetics and politics of everyday life. Readings include ethnographies and social histories of textiles, fashion, and the manufacture of garments including cases from India, Guatemala, Italy, China, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Trinidad, and the United States.",

Japan currently faces a historically crucial moment as it fosters more international ties—both within and outside Asia—moving beyond its postwar relationship with the United States. In this seminar, we discuss topics of the workplace, schooling, youth culture, family matters, gender and feminism, religion and nationalism, social media, and demographic challenges. As such, the course draws on scholarship from across the social sciences as well as a broad range of perspectives about contemporary Japan, considering thematically coherent issues that inform students on how Japan’s complex society may be approached by anthropologists.",

To many in Asia and the non-Western world, Japan looked like a new model of anti-Western, anti-imperial modernity. However, the ensuing decades would see this image contested. The expansion of Japan’s political and economic power into East Asia over the first half of the twentieth century has shaped the region in ways still visible today. This course is split into three parts, each covering roughly two decades. First, we look at the legacies of Japan’s Meiji Restoration and the development of what has been called an \"Imperial Democracy\" in early 20th century Japan. Next, we look at the crises which rocked Japan in the 1930s and marked a new era. Finally,  we deal with the aftermath of empire—both in the immediate \"postwar\" era for Japan, and in the debates over imperial legacies and history which still reverberate in Japan and many of its former colonies today.",

The long eighteenth-century saw the rise of the novel as we know it as well as a major intellectual shift in how the passions and emotions were conceptualized. We investigate the relationship between these developments, particularly as they converged in the cultural movement of sentimentalism. With our focus on this historical nexus, we take up broader questions about the ways that aesthetic form mediates the emotions, and the ways that emotion responds to social realities like capitalism, imperialism, secularization and patriarchy. Our focus is on those feelings that might be considered distinctively novelistic—feelings that have influentially served to theorize the novel as a genre (interest for the German romantics; desire for psychoanalytic accounts of narrative), and that novels of the period helped codify and theorize (embarrassment, sympathy, wonder, happiness, complicity). Authors include Eliza Haywood, Daniel Defoe, Laurence Sterne, Henry Mackenzie, Frances Burney, William Beckford, William Godwin, and Jane Austen.",

The course aims for broad regional coverage, with particular focus on several important nation-states (e.g., Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq) and Western interventions in them. Students should emerge with a keener sense of Middle Eastern regional histories and contemporary social issues, as described by leading scholars in the field of Middle Eastern studies and particularly Middle Eastern anthropology. Following a historical introduction, the course is organized around three core themes—Islam, politics, modernity—with movement from the macropolitical level of Islamic discourse and state politics to the most intimate domains of gender, family life, and contemporary youth culture. Through reading, thinking, talking, and writing about a series of book-length monographs, students gain broad exposure to a number of exigent issues in the Middle Eastern region, as well as to the ethnographic methodologies and critical theories of Middle East anthropologists. Students are graded on seminar participation, leadership of seminar discussions, two review/analysis papers, and a comparative written review of three books. Required for Council on Middle East Studies (CMES) graduate certificate students. Recommended for Middle East concentrators in other disciplines.",

        "description": "This interdisciplinary seminar is designed to introduce students to some of the most pressing contemporary cultural and political issues shaping life in the Middle East and North Africa. The course aims for broad regional coverage, with particular focus on several important nation-states (e.g., Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq) and Western interventions in them. Students should emerge with a keener sense of Middle Eastern regional histories and contemporary social issues, as described by leading scholars in the field of Middle Eastern studies and particularly Middle Eastern anthropology. Following a historical introduction, the course is organized around three core themes—Islam, politics, modernity—with movement from the macropolitical level of Islamic discourse and state politics to the most intimate domains of gender, family life, and contemporary youth culture. Through reading, thinking, talking, and writing about a series of book-length monographs, students gain broad exposure to a number of exigent issues in the Middle Eastern region, as well as to the ethnographic methodologies and critical theories of Middle East anthropologists. Students are graded on seminar participation, leadership of seminar discussions, two review/analysis papers, and a comparative written review of three books. Required for Council on Middle East Studies (CMES) graduate certificate students. Recommended for Middle East concentrators in other disciplines.",

In this course we will reflect on the relation between Galileo’s anti-Aristotelian physics and Hobbes’ system by reading key texts by Galileo and Hobbes along with an array of interpretations and criticisms of Hobbes that will serve to situate Hobbes in early modern currents of thought in science, religion and politics, while at the same time situating us in contemporary ideological debates about the origins of modernity.",

This was an Anglophile world order―one defined by the markets, connections and ideologies of the British imperial enterprise. By the end of the next century, a different story was to be told. The British Empire had come undone and instead a new age of nation-states was firmly underway. The ideological legitimacy of British imperialism had been relentlessly challenged and the myth of the white man’s burden severely undermined if not completely debunked. How did this come to be? This is an advanced seminar on the global history of decolonization in the British Empire.",

This course introduces students to the study of language through the lens of English word structure, with occasional glances at the structure of words in other languages of the world. We study different ways of forming new words from prefixes and suffixes, as well from compounding, blending, and other more exotic processes. We study the sound structure of words and how they are used in sentences. We study what happens when English adopts words from other languages, and when English words are used in other languages, and how words change their sound, shape, and meaning over time. Finally, we discuss the different 'effects' that different words might have in conversation, and the issues that word choice raises in society at large.",

Likewise, what role can the city play in establishing, interrogating, and extrapolating the limits of architecture, whether as a practice, a discourse, or a physical manifestation of human endeavor in the material environment? This course addresses these and other, related questions, seeking to position art and architecture in their broader urban, social, cultural, political, intellectual, and aesthetic contexts. It explores issues of social justice as they relate to the material spaces of the modern city, and the manner in which those spaces are identified, codified, and made operative in service of aesthetic, social, and political experience.

        "course_id": 200310790,
        "description": "What is architecture, and how is it conceived, relative to notions of the urban – to the broader, deeper, messier web of ideas, forms, and fantasies constituting \"the city?\" Can architecture play a role in defining the city, as such, or does the city’s political and social construction place it outside the scope of specifically architectural concerns? Likewise, what role can the city play in establishing, interrogating, and extrapolating the limits of architecture, whether as a practice, a discourse, or a physical manifestation of human endeavor in the material environment? This course addresses these and other, related questions, seeking to position art and architecture in their broader urban, social, cultural, political, intellectual, and aesthetic contexts. It explores issues of social justice as they relate to the material spaces of the modern city, and the manner in which those spaces are identified, codified, and made operative in service of aesthetic, social, and political experience. Enrollment limited to first-year students. Preregistration required; see under First-Year Seminar Program.",

We look at how they wrestled with the legitimacy and efficacy of new forms of mass political action, such as the boycott, the general strike, as well as revolutionary violence. We cover debates on the use of violence and nonviolence as a technique of popular protest and collective mobilization. Thinkers to be considered include: Lenin, Sorel, Weber, Niebuhr, Gandhi, Camus, Fanon, King, Arendt.",

This course explores how we can use computational methods to pursue questions in the humanities, while also looking at how humanistic methods can inform the work of algorithms in research and society at large. We begin this course with a series of questions at the intersections of the humanities and quantitative analysis: What is data? How can we turn texts into data? To explore these questions from both theoretical and technical perspectives, each course week is divided into discussion and lab sessions. Discussion sessions introduce concepts and humanities-based case studies that ground the hands-on technical work done in the labs. We survey some of the most popular methods in modern data science—classification, vectorization, and visualization—to see what kinds of questions we can ask and answer. We conclude the semester with open lab sessions during which students leverage the skills covered in this course to create their own data science projects with cultural heritage data.",

Most points on a map are less than 1 km from the nearest wetland. Yet wetlands are nearly invisible to most people. In this course we explore wetlands in all of their dimensions, including the critical services they provide to other systems, the rich biodiversity they harbor, their impact on global climate, and the links by which they connect to other systems. Additionally, wetlands are lynchpin environments for scientific policy and regulation. The overarching aim of the course is to connect what we know about wetlands from a scientific perspective to the ways in which wetlands matter for people.",

Evolution explains the origin of life and Earth's biodiversity, and how organisms acquire adaptations that improve survival and reproduction. This course uses reading and discussion of scientific papers to emphasize that evolutionary biology is a dynamic science, involving active research to better understand the mysteries of life. We discuss principles of population genetics, paleontology, and systematics; application of evolutionary thinking in disciplines such as developmental biology, ecology, microbiology, molecular biology, and human medicine.",

        "description": "Organisms are routinely faced with many abiotic and biotic pressures that impact their survivorship, growth, and reproductive success. For example, a lizard’s ability to perform fitness-based tasks (like foraging or predator evasion) is limited by the thermal dependence of its performance, its hydric and metabolic economy, and its morphological dimensions. Yet, organisms are not exclusively at the whim and mercy of their surroundings. Of key importance is the preeminent role that organisms exert on their own selective environments and, correspondingly, on their evolution. This course considers the diverse ways in which organisms engineer their own evolutionary trajectories. Some of the topics we cover include niche construction, extended phenotypes, behavioral drive, the Bogert effect, and adaptive virulence (particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic).",

Materials for study include humanistic and social scientific critique, ethnographies of technology, technical writing and scientific papers, as well as speculative art practices including design, visual art and fiction. What assumptions and politics of imagination govern the design and development of new technologies? What alternative imaginaries, politics, or even speculations, can be identified with a feminist analytic lens? The seminar also includes a practicum component where we practice the politics of speculation through writing and design projects. To do this we study everything from active STEM projects at Yale to speculative fiction and film to think about how structures of race, gender, sexuality, ability, nation, and religious difference inform how we \"speculate\" or imagine the future through the ways we design and build technological worlds in practice and in fiction.",

But the course also engages with poems from other faith traditions, as well as with poems that are wholly secular and even adamantly antireligious. Area V.",

The essential claim of the Sublime, writes Thomas Weiskel, is that we can transcend the human. The etymology of the word suggests moving beyond limits. To study the Sublime, then, is to confront what it means to be human at and beyond our limits, whether those limits are constructed individually, socially, intellectually, emotionally, perceptually, or otherwise. The writers and artists we examine in this course show us that the affective registers of a confrontation with the Sublime include fear, confusion, humility, weakness, despair and (often at the same time) such opposites as courage, clarity, strength, wisdom, and ecstasy. Together we interrogative the conditions and significance of all of these Sublime feelings, and then take what we learn and attempt to investigate the role of the Sublime in our contemporary moment, and through our own personal experience.",

Now hardly nobody, Emily Dickinson is widely recognized as one of the most original and difficult poets ever to write poetry. This seminar explores a variety of methodological approaches to her work. We close-read a wide range of her poems, seeking to understand important tensions that run throughout her oeuvre, between feeling and intellect, chaos and control, power and passivity, things hidden and revealed, ecstasy and despair, life and death. We also locate Dickinson in her historical moment and personal community, and in the context of important precursors and sources of literary influence (and agon), including the Bible, English Romantic poetry, and the essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Attention is paid to Dickinson’s identity as a woman writing within and against an inherited tradition of male poets and thinkers, as well as to Dickinson’s relation to other important women writers whom she read, such as George Eliot, the Brontës, and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Attention is also paid to the unique materiality and process of Dickinson’s poetic craft. Considerations of these features of her poems, of her innovations in syntax and punctuation, and of the complex history of editing and publishing her work, allows us to question more deeply certain assumed or uncontested categories in the study of poetry, such as lyric, and even \"poem\" itself.",

Ecstasy derives from the Greek ekstasis, meaning \"to stand outside (of oneself),\" and the term has been used in various cultural and historical contexts to describe modes of experiential and intellectual transcendence in traditions of ritual, mysticism, performance, hermeneutics, literary theory and criticism, poetry, and poetics. The course takes primarily structural, psychological, and phenomenological approaches to the topics of ecstasy and the ecstatic in religion and literature, in order to think through what ecstasy \"is,\" when and why it happens, what it achieves, and how it does so. The course explores the relationship between ecstasy and other religious categories such as doctrine, praxis, ethics, faith, and service. Likewise, we locate ecstasy as a major element in poetic traditions, and its relationship to metaphor, poetic influence, demonic possession, and the Sublime.",

Whether as a rhetorical or a dramatic device, written or oral, fictional or not, dialogue substantiates the core of any intersubjective communication, building bridges between the self and the Other while maintaining them as two separate entities. This seminar explores the form and function of dialogue through a wide range of theoretical and literary texts, focusing on a set of social, hermeneutical, poetical, and political questions. Specific attention is given to literary cases of failed dialogues and miscomprehension, aiming at the unique potential of the literary text to draw our attention beyond the limits of human communication and language. Readings include texts by Plato, Buber, Mead, Habermas, Bakhtin, Schleiermacher, Gadamer, Kristeva, Glissant, Shakespeare, Goethe, Austen, Beckett, Schnitzler, Gogol, Celan, Herta Müller, and others.\n\nUpon attending a weekly discussion section in German, the course may be counted towards the German Advanced Language Certificate.",

        "description": "One of the most obvious and agreed-upon traits of realist literature seems to be its exclusion of the fantastic; the two are typically seen as opposites which define strictly different modes and genres of literature. However, while the term fantastic conjures up products of the imagination—Einbildungskraft, phantasía—, one of the most influential theorizations of the fantastic consists precisely in a text’s leaving undecided the question of whether or not a ‘fantastical’ element is a product of the characters’ or the narrator’s imagination (Tzvetan Todorov). The course uses this paradox as a point of departure to explore mainly, but by no means only German-language literary and programmatic texts of the past 200 years and their entanglements of realism and the fantastic. We study, among other things, ghosts, doppelgänger, recent modes of magical realism, and their functions. Readings include E.T.A. Hoffmann, Theodor Fontane, Henry James, Franz Kafka, Emine Sevgi Özdamar, Haruki Murakami, and Olga Tokarczuk.",

We then read major works by Kant, Hegel and Schelling against that background. Other authors include Conway, Herrera, Jacobi, Kierkegaard, Lessing and Mendelssohn.

Attention is paid to Dickinson’s identity as a woman writing within and against an inherited tradition of male poets and thinkers, as well as to Dickinson’s relation to other important women writers whom she read, such as George Eliot, the Brontës, and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Attention is also paid to the unique materiality and process of Dickinson’s poetic craft. Considerations of these features of her poems, of her innovations in syntax and punctuation, and of the complex history of editing and publishing her work, allows us to question more deeply certain assumed or uncontested categories in the study of poetry, such as lyric, and even \"poem\" itself.",

Ecstasy derives from the Greek ekstasis, meaning \"to stand outside (of oneself),\" and the term has been used in various cultural and historical contexts to describe modes of experiential and intellectual transcendence in traditions of ritual, mysticism, performance, hermeneutics, literary theory and criticism, poetry, and poetics. The course takes primarily structural, psychological, and phenomenological approaches to the topics of ecstasy and the ecstatic in religion and literature, in order to think through what ecstasy \"is,\" when and why it happens, what it achieves, and how it does so. The course explores the relationship between ecstasy and other religious categories such as doctrine, praxis, ethics, faith, and service. Likewise, we locate ecstasy as a major element in poetic traditions, and its relationship to metaphor, poetic influence, demonic possession, and the Sublime.",

Whether as a rhetorical or a dramatic device, written or oral, fictional or not, dialogue substantiates the core of any intersubjective communication, building bridges between the self and the Other while maintaining them as two separate entities. This seminar explores the form and function of dialogue through a wide range of theoretical and literary texts, focusing on a set of social, hermeneutical, poetical, and political questions. Specific attention is given to literary cases of failed dialogues and miscomprehension, aiming at the unique potential of the literary text to draw our attention beyond the limits of human communication and language. Readings include texts by Plato, Buber, Mead, Habermas, Bakhtin, Schleiermacher, Gadamer, Kristeva, Glissant, Shakespeare, Goethe, Austen, Beckett, Schnitzler, Gogol, Celan, Herta Müller, and others.\n\nUpon attending a weekly discussion section in German, the course may be counted towards the German Advanced Language Certificate.",

        "description": "One of the most obvious and agreed-upon traits of realist literature seems to be its exclusion of the fantastic; the two are typically seen as opposites which define strictly different modes and genres of literature. However, while the term fantastic conjures up products of the imagination—Einbildungskraft, phantasía—, one of the most influential theorizations of the fantastic consists precisely in a text’s leaving undecided the question of whether or not a ‘fantastical’ element is a product of the characters’ or the narrator’s imagination (Tzvetan Todorov). The course uses this paradox as a point of departure to explore mainly, but by no means only German-language literary and programmatic texts of the past 200 years and their entanglements of realism and the fantastic. We study, among other things, ghosts, doppelgänger, recent modes of magical realism, and their functions. Readings include E.T.A. Hoffmann, Theodor Fontane, Henry James, Franz Kafka, Emine Sevgi Özdamar, Haruki Murakami, and Olga Tokarczuk.",

We then read major works by Kant, Hegel and Schelling against that background. Other authors include Conway, Herrera, Jacobi, Kierkegaard, Lessing and Mendelssohn.

In terms of content, our aim is to understand what various philosophers thought about causation, what similarities and differences emerge among the figures we study, and what coherent narrative (if any) can be told about the concept of causation throughout the ages. Of equal, if not greater, importance is the aim of improving our abilities to read difficult philosophical texts with both a charitable and critical eye.",

On the other hand, other philosophers have argued that the free agent does not use the will to choose, as often there is only one rational course of action, and thus no space for choice within the will, which must simply follow the intellect–otherwise the agent is acting against reason and hence unfreely, and if the agent is acting irrationally, they cannot be responsible either. This course focuses on this debate (sometimes characterized as a debate between voluntarism and intellectualism), considering the arguments on both sides, and whether a satisfactory solution can be found. The debate has a long history, which provides the background to the course, and thus focuses on work by thinkers such as Augustine, Luther, Leibniz, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Sartre, and Murdoch. We do not follow their writings in chronological order, but trace out various conceptual connections on this issue that can be found in their works. We do consider how the debate connect to related issues in philosophy of religion, ethics, and metaphysics.",

As such, the study of games serves as an entry point to a number of topics of potential interest, rather than just an in-depth study of one topic.",

We start with three foundational debates of the twentieth century: Quine vs. Carnap on ontological commitment, Russell vs. Strawson on reference, and Ayer vs. Geach on expressivism. The remainder of the class is divided into two parts: the philosophy of semantics and the philosophy of pragmatics. The first part covers the topics of reference and quantification, tense and modality, intentionality, and compositionality. The second deals with context and content, force and mood, implicature, and common ground. The core of the course is a manuscript written jointly with Rich Thomason, which will be supplemented with classic papers in the philosophy of language.",

        "description": "Both the ideology and practices of Nazi Germany rank among the most insidious the world has ever seen. For this reason, this historical era has generated, simultaneously, immense revulsion and immense fascination among scholars. They have attempted to explain how such a regime could emerge, how its citizens could come to support it, how it could carry out atrocities with such scale and brutality, and how Germany could rebuild itself after such physical and ideological violence. In this course, we join these scholars in trying to understand Nazi Germany. Together, we chart the rise and fall of National Socialism in Germany from the early twentieth century through the decades after the end of the Second World War. Via a collection of both primary and secondary source literature, we confront some of the most contentious debates in this field of study: what made Nazism so popular among ordinary Germans? How do we interpret Hitler’s role in its development? Was German violence toward Jews and other groups slated for murder a product of deep-seated antisemitism and xenophobia or did it evolve organically over the course of the Nazi period? Did the Holocaust form from the top down as the product of a small collection of people driven by the demands of the Führer, or from the bottom up as a function of shifting circumstances like the trajectory of the Second World War? How can we understand the emergence of camps and killing fields? How do we make sense of the complicated registers of German guilt for the events of the Nazi period? Is it useful (or appropriate) to compare the Holocaust to other genocides? This course exposes students to the range of answers that responsible and meticulous historical research has offered to these questions. There are, however, mountains of literature that have been written on the rise, lifespan, and fall of National Socialism. This course can only begin to chip away modestly at that mass. Nevertheless, the goal is that, by the end of the semester, students develop a sense of the outlines of the major historiographical debates about this period and give thought to the ways that those debates remain relevant to our contemporary world.",

We read works by a wide range of literary and political thinkers from the last two-and-a-half centuries or so, reflecting especially on questions such as: What is the relationship between literature and politics? How does social change play out in literature, and, in turn, what role might literature play in social change? Where does the category of the ‘literary’ come from, and how does it relate to key political categories such as ‘the people’? How might literature—and the arts generally—be of use to us in our attempts to create a more just, free, and equal society? How might a more just, free, and equal society allow us to relate to literature and the arts? On the literary side, our writers may include William Wordsworth, Jane Austen, W.B. Yeats, Virginia Woolf, Federico Garcia Lorca, Pablo Neruda, Czeslaw Milosz, Wislawa Szymborska, Audre Lorde, Seamus Heaney, Milan Kundera.  On the political side, our thinkers may include Edmund Burke, Mary Wollstonecraft, J.S.

Students will grapple with primary and secondary sources which prompt them to think critically about the past and present of psychology and the ways in which systems of race, gender, and class inequality interact with major institutions, systems, and their own research practices. Students will study the historical relationship between the \"mind sciences\" and the intertwined systems/institutions of white supremacy/racial hierarchy, cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, empire, and colonialism from the 17th century to the present. Students will also examine the role some psychologists and related scientists and scholars have played in challenging and resisting those same intertwined systems and institutions. This course is interdisciplinary in that, in addition to studying works by psychologists, students will study, analyze, and critique works in other fields – such as history, anthropology, ethnic studies, and postcolonial studies – which are relevant to understanding the historical development of the psychological sciences.",

From the family and the home to the workplace, from the University, and the Corporation, to the Military and Media, we track how inequalities emerge and are sustained by power and institutional structures. We also see how they are challenged and what sorts of instruments are needed to challenge them. In particular, we focus on sexual politics and sexual violence as a key issue to understanding the gendered workings of institutions, in order to examine structures that sustain inequality. Through the semester, we hope to consider many domains of life–bedrooms and boardrooms, international borders and feminist movements–to understand the stubborn and sticky forms and hierarchies of power that are challenged and contested by activists, scholars, and communities.",

We undertake a historical survey of ancient rhetoric, supplementing George Kennedy’s A New History of Classical Rhetoric with excerpted primary readings from the sources it covers during the first meeting of the week. During the second meeting of the week we read and analyze Aristotle’s Art of Rhetoric with the goal of studying how Greek antiquity’s premier treatise on rhetoric interacts with evidence from rhetorical practice (or competing works of rhetorical theory) over the period under consideration. We also pause periodically in our reading of Aristotle to \"spotlight\" five famous speeches (by Demosthenes, Cicero, Gregory of Nazianzus, Elizabeth I, and Frederick Douglass) that draw on and contribute to the richness of the classical rhetorical tradition and its afterlife.",

        "course_id": 210124573,
        "description": "This course is intended for undergraduate physics, chemistry, engineering, computer science, statistics and data science, and mathematics majors seeking an introduction to quantum information science. There is now a second quantum revolution underway and a world-wide race to build powerful new types of computers based on quantum principles, and to develop new techniques for encrypted communication whose security is guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics. The approach of this course to these topics will strip away much of the traditional physics details to focus on the information content of quantum systems, the nature of measurement, and why the true randomness of certain measurement results can be a feature rather than a bug. We learn what it means for a quantum bit (‘qubit’) to be simultaneously 0 and 1 (in some sense). We learn about quantum entanglement and the associated ‘spooky action at a distance’ that convinced Einstein that the quantum theory must be wrong. Ironically, this bizarre effect is now used on a daily basis to prove that quantum mechanics is indeed correct and used as a routine engineering test to make sure that quantum computers are working properly and are truly quantum. Specific topics include: the mathematical representation of quantum states as complex vectors, the superposition principle, entanglement and Bell inequalities, quantum gates and algorithms for quantum computers, quantum error correction, dense coding, teleportation, and secure quantum communication. Students learn to do problem sets based on programming and operating publicly-accessible cloud-based quantum computers. See for example: https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/.",

However, 20th Century international data governance policies, normative frameworks, and domestic regulations are struggling to keep pace with the disruptive impacts ICTs are having on an increasingly digitally networked world. This seminar explores critical issues, trends, and events relevant to both the adaption of existing data governance regimes to meet these challenges and the creation of new regimes by international organizations, the private sector, civil society, and national governments. The primary learning goal of the course is to equip students with the skills to critically read and apply extant international data governance policies in concrete sector-specific contexts (i.e. corporate, governmental, humanitarian, development, etc.). Additionally, students learn to identify gaps in current regimes and to be literate in the major ongoing debates on these issues at the United Nations, the EU, the United States Congress, and other critical loci of policy development.",

        "description": "With its lush and fantastic landscape, fabulous carnivalesque aesthetics, and rich African Diaspora Religious traditions, the Caribbean has long been a setting where New World black artists have staged competing visions of racial and sexual utopia and dystopia. However, these foreigner-authored fantasies have often overshadowed the lived experience and life storytelling of Caribbean subjects. This course explores the intersecting performance cultures, politics, and sensual/sexual practices that have constituted queer life in the Caribbean region and its diaspora. Placing Caribbean queer of color critique alongside key moments in twentieth and twenty-first century performance history at home and abroad, we ask how have histories of the plantation, discourses of race and nation, migration, and revolution led to the formation of regionally specific queer identifications. What about the idea of the \"tropics\" has made it such as fertile ground for queer performance making, and how have artists from the region identified or dis-identified with these aesthetic formations? This class begins with an exploration of theories of queer diaspora and queer of color critique’s roots in black feminisms. We cover themes of exile, religious rites, and organizing as sights of queer political formation and creative community in the Caribbean.",

Its plot, which describes the Devil’s visit to Moscow in the 1930s, has no analogues in modern Russian literature: it mixes ingeniously the elements of adventure, romance, history, philosophy, fantasy, and satirical novels. Bulgakov worked on his magnum opus for twelve years, from 1928 and until his death in 1940. The novel, however, was not published until 1966, when the first section appeared in the magazine Moskva, which sold out within hours. For contemporary readers, Bulgakov’s text is a treasure trove of insight about society, culture, morality, economics, power, religion, entertainment, politics, police, and everyday life in the Stalin era. But Bulgakov also raises deep philosophical issues: the various chapters of The Master and Margarita are case studies dealing provocatively and in depth with the meaning of life and the fear of death, good and evil, love and loyalty, ethics and responsibility, and so much more. As a bonus, the final chapters offer us Bulgakov’s own recipe for happiness. During the semester, we dive into the intricacies of Bulgakov's narrative, studying not only the structure, content, and characters of the novel, but also—through some visual sources and scholarly articles—the history of Stalinist Moscow, and the textual sources that permeate the book, from the Bible, Goethe’s Faust, and Dante’s The Divine Comedy, to Gogol and Pushkin, to Bulgakov's fellow writers and philosophers.",

        "description": "It is estimated that the construction and operation of buildings accounts for nearly 40% of carbon emissions globally. If a radical decarbonization of architectural practice stands as the discipline’s central challenge today, this calls not only for new solutions, but for different engagement with architecture’s history. This discussion seminar reinterprets histories of modern architecture through the concept of \"energy cultures.\" An energy culture (Sheller, 2014; Szeemann and Diamanti, 2019) can be defined as the specific assemblage of fuel, matter, practice, labor, and meaning that have informed architecture’s conceptualization and construction. In contrast to approaches that stress quantitative, technical, and instrumental approaches to energy accounting and energy efficiency, this course looks at how different representations, concepts, and behaviors emerged in response to historic shifts in energy production and consumption. The first portion of the course surveys a range of historical approaches to concepts of energy and environmental justice within and adjacent to architecture. The bulk of the course then turns to case studies, examining particular buildings and projects in order to develop new interpretations and questions about these monuments based on an energy cultures approach.",

The class focuses mainly on the British New Wave and K-Pop because these two genres of popular music have strong ties to particular geographic areas, but they became or have become extremely popular in other parts of the world. We also investigate the importance of music videos in the development of these genres.",

The course examines: the environmental legacies of colonialism, the role of ecology in anticolonial movements, early articulations of environmental justice in the 1970s, the role of violence and repression in state responses to environmental activism, the rise of increasingly networked environmental movements from the Global South that made themselves heard at the Rio Earth Summit of 1992—which took place 30 years ago, and the moral and political histories that underpin the negotiating stance of countries of the Global South in climate change negotiations. This class makes extensive use of primary sources, including material from the Yale collections and it straddles the boundaries between environmental, intellectual, and political history.",

        "description": "The borders that constitute the geographical divisions of the world are contingent, but they can have enormous ordering power in the lives of people and other beings. Human-made borders can both allow and disallow the flow of people and resources. Like geographical borders, social borders such as race, caste, class, and gender can form and perpetuate privileged categories of humans that restrict access of excluded persons to natural resources, education, security, and social mobility. Thus, bordering can differentially value human lives. Working with the premise that borders are sites of power, in this course we study bordering and debordering practices in the Hispanic cultures of Iberia, Latin America, and North America, from the 1490s to the present. Through analyses of a wide range of texts students will investigate the multiple ways in which social, cultural, and spatial borders are initiated, expressed, materialized, and contested. Some of the questions that will guide our conversations are: What are social borders and what are the processes through which they perdure? How do the effects of local practices that transcend borders (e.g., environmental pollution, deforestation) change our understanding of borders? How does globalization change discourse about borders? (To be conducted in Spanish.)",

Domestically, martial arts films have served to promote the nation, while on the international arena, they have been one of the primary conduits of transnational cinematic interaction, as kung-fu or samurai films have influenced films inside and outside East Asia, from The Matrix to Kill Bill. Martial arts cinema has become a crucial means for thinking through such issues as nation, ethnicity, history, East vs. West, the body, gender, sexuality, stardom, industry, spirituality, philosophy, and mediality, from modernity to postmodernity. It is thus not surprising that martial arts films have also attracted some of the world’s best filmmakers, ranging from Kurosawa Akira to Wong Kar Wai. This course focuses on films from Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea—as well as on works from other countries influenced by them—covering such martial arts genres such as the samurai film, kung-fu, karate, wuxia, and related historical epics. It provides a historical survey of each nation and genre, while connecting them to other genres, countries, and media.",

        "description": "The martial arts film has not only been a central genre for many East Asian cinemas, it has been the cinematic form that has most defined those cinemas for others. Domestically, martial arts films have served to promote the nation, while on the international arena, they have been one of the primary conduits of transnational cinematic interaction, as kung-fu or samurai films have influenced films inside and outside East Asia, from The Matrix to Kill Bill. Martial arts cinema has become a crucial means for thinking through such issues as nation, ethnicity, history, East vs. West, the body, gender, sexuality, stardom, industry, spirituality, philosophy, and mediality, from modernity to postmodernity. It is thus not surprising that martial arts films have also attracted some of the world’s best filmmakers, ranging from Kurosawa Akira to Wong Kar Wai. This course focuses on films from Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea—as well as on works from other countries influenced by them—covering such martial arts genres such as the samurai film, kung-fu, karate, wuxia, and related historical epics. It provides a historical survey of each nation and genre, while connecting them to other genres, countries, and media.",

The field is rapidly evolving and, although an effort will be made to keep abreast of the latest developments, the course emphasis is on timeless fundamentals, especially from a physics perspective. Topics under consideration include: key concepts of climate change as a result of global warming, which is the primary motivator of a shift in energy supply and technologies to wean humanity off fossil fuels; carbon-free energy sources, with primary focus on solar, wind and associated needs for energy storage and grid upgrade; traditional fossil-fuel power plants and engines, that are currently involved in 85% of energy conversion worldwide and we can’t \"turn on a dime\". Elements of thermodynamics are covered throughout the course as needed, including the definition of various forms of energy, work and heat as energy transfer, the principle of conservation of energy, first law and second law, and rudiments of heat engines. We conclude with some considerations on energy policy and with the \"big picture\" on how to tackle future energy needs.  Designed for juniors and seniors in science and engineering.",

They expressed themselves in the speculative fiction of Michael Crichton in terms of monsters: the virus in The Andromeda Strain, the androids in Westworld, the velociraptors of Jurassic Park, and even the patients maimed by gunshot wounds in ER. Crichton wrote thrilling stories that also asked his readers to consider what monsters humans could make if they didn’t stop to consider whether or not they should.

As a nation, our drug use ranges from everyday activities, such as drinking coffee or beer, to combating illnesses with prescription medications, to using illegal drugs for recreation. This course follow a loose chronology beginning in the early twentieth century and ending in the present day. Instead of focusing on the biography of a single drug, or class of drugs, this course incorporates a wide range of substances, including alcohol, cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, psychedelics, and narcotics. Through a selection of essays, book chapters, and primary source material, we discuss how certain ways of using and selling drugs have been sanctioned and encouraged, while others have been pathologized as addiction or criminalized. We explore how drug definitions are constructed, how they shift over time, and how they reflect, reinforce, and sometimes challenge anxieties about race, disability, sexuality, and gender. Throughout the course, films, images, music, and television episodes are also presented as objects of analysis to provide insight into the cultural lives of drugs. We explore how historians approach this subject, assess their sources and assumptions, and consider the choices they have made in researching and writing. Students are expected to apply these historical lessons to the present and demonstrate the ability to think and write critically about the history of drugs.",

        "description": "Is health care a human right? Can health advocacy shape health policy? What does it mean to be a health \"activist\" and to demand change of medicine? Health care in America has always been political. In this seminar students explore the rich history of health activism and health advocacy in the modern United States, focusing primarily on the postwar period through the present day. Each week we encounter new varieties of grassroots organizing, individual activists, and advocacy organizations that have made political claims about health care and pushed for its reform. We examine how health activism shapes broader cultural conversations about health and the practice of medicine itself. This course does not aim to provide a comprehensive history of health activism in modern America, but rather takes a case study approach, for critical analysis of themes and tactics. For each session, students read a selection of essays, book chapters, or primary source materials about a particular variety of health activism. Through these readings, we discuss how the critiques of activists and the responses by medical practitioners reveal the significant impact of race, gender, class, and sexuality on the provision of health care in this country. We also consider how historians have approached this subject, both as scholars and participant-observers. Students become adept at primary source analysis and able to engage in scholarly conversations with secondary sources.",

        "description": "In every African colony after World War Two there emerged nationalist movements which no longer called for civil rights as in the pre-war years but demanded self-determination. While many of them got it easy, some had to fight long and bloody wars for it. By the 1960s the colonial edifice had crumbled except for the few settler colonies in southern Africa. But even here the winds of change could not be stopped. But what did decolonization and independence mean to Africa? Did Africans get what they wanted? Was independence a cup of plenty or a poisoned chalice? In addressing these questions, this course charts the economic, political, and cultural transformations of postcolonial Africa from the 1960s to the present. The argument is this: there can be no understanding of Africa’s challenges today without an inquiry into the nature of what the continent got from the departing colonial powers.",

We locate U.S. culture and politics within an international dynamic, exposing the interrelatedness of domestic and foreign affairs. While exploring specific geopolitical events like the Spanish-American War, World War I and II, and the Cold War, this course emphasizes the political importance of culture and ideology rather than offering a formal overview of U.S. foreign policy. How have Americans across the twentieth century drawn from ideas about gender to understand their country’s relationship to the wider world? In what ways have gendered ideologies and gendered approaches to politics shaped America’s performance on the world’s stage? How have geopolitical events impacted the construction of race and gender on the home front? In the most general sense, this course is designed to encourage students to understand American cultural and gender history as the product of America’s engagement with the world. In so doing, we explore the rise of U.S. global power as an enterprise deeply related to conceptions of race, sexuality, and gender. We also examine films, political speeches, visual culture, music, and popular culture.",

We watch all five seasons of the show as social scientists and use it to learn about important social scientific concepts and theories, and apply those theories to such phenomena as the politics of crime, policing, and local elections. Each week, the assigned readings—articles and book excerpts from political science as well as other social sciences—highlight the social scientific concepts displayed in the assigned episodes and provide context for lectures. All of the assignments work together to expose students to social science, how social science is conducted, and how political science can help us better understand the world around us.",

This course is designed to give students firsthand knowledge of tropical biology and the issues surrounding conservation of biodiversity in a developing nation through a combination of in-class discussions and a mandatory field trip over spring break. The emphasis is on active learning and developing independent research projects carried out during the field trip. Using a case-study approach, topics covered include patterns of biodiversity, tropical forest dynamics, reforestation, species interactions and coevolution, climate change impacts, ecosystem services, and human land use. Students also gain experience with study design, data collection methods, and statistical analysis. This year's field trip is to Panama, a country famous for its high biological, cultural, and economic diversity. We visit a variety of forest ecosystems and hear firsthand from scientists about current research in the field. Students undertake two short-term research projects and also learn basic identification and natural history of tropical plant, bird, and insect species. As this is a course in field ecology, students should expect to spend a major part of each day outside in the natural tropical environment under adverse conditions. Enrollment limited to fifteen; priority given to students who have taken F&ES 752a.",

Instead of focusing on the biography of a single drug, or class of drugs, this course incorporates a wide range of substances, including alcohol, cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, psychedelics, and narcotics. Through a selection of essays, book chapters, and primary source material, we discuss how certain ways of using and selling drugs have been sanctioned and encouraged, while others have been pathologized as addiction or criminalized. We explore how drug definitions are constructed, how they shift over time, and how they reflect, reinforce, and sometimes challenge anxieties about race, disability, sexuality, and gender. Throughout the course, films, images, music, and television episodes are also presented as objects of analysis to provide insight into the cultural lives of drugs. We explore how historians approach this subject, assess their sources and assumptions, and consider the choices they have made in researching and writing.

Through a selection of essays, book chapters, and primary source material, we discuss how certain ways of using and selling drugs have been sanctioned and encouraged, while others have been pathologized as addiction or criminalized. We explore how drug definitions are constructed, how they shift over time, and how they reflect, reinforce, and sometimes challenge anxieties about race, disability, sexuality, and gender. Throughout the course, films, images, music, and television episodes are also presented as objects of analysis to provide insight into the cultural lives of drugs. We explore how historians approach this subject, assess their sources and assumptions, and consider the choices they have made in researching and writing. Students are expected to apply these historical lessons to the present and demonstrate the ability to think and write critically about the history of drugs.",

We study past forms of inequality and importantly, how societies explained and justified the existence of often pronounced inequality, and then turn to the question what sustains inequality today. Topics covered are inequalities of income, of banking and money, housing, health, education, opportunity, among others. Each of these topics have readings that allow us to trace back the history of such issues as well as readings that deal with contemporary expressions of the same problem. We pay particular attention to the role that discrimination on the basis of race and gender plays in all of this.",

How similar and how different were these episodes? Did they emerge against a common structural and societal backdrop? Did they equally serve their ideals and liberate their people against tyranny? What was the role of women and the position of ethnic minorities in the fledgling nation-states? As the year 2021 marks the bicentennial of the Greek Revolution of 1821, special attention is given to the intricate links forged between Greek revolutionary intellectuals and their peers in Europe and other continents",

We consider the relation between visual representation and political representation, addressing how artists and architects have responded to the demands of democracy, empire, war, and revolution, and how individuals and communities have reacted with and against the works that they produced. Topics span from propaganda to public monuments, icons to iconoclasm, civic buildings to border walls, and from the politics of display to political censorship. Ranging from painting, sculpture, prints, and photography to architecture, landscape design, and military fortification, this course aims to de-center ‘western’ notions of artistic achievement in its multi-media and transnational scope. Lectures and assignments emphasize close looking and close reading, skills which are essential to making us better viewers and citizens.

By the 1990s the prominence of artists of color such as Yinka Shonibare prefigured the dynamic and cosmopolitan art scene of the present day. After Brexit, after Covid, what is the future for British art and for London?",

        "description": "This global introductory course surveys how works of art and architecture have responded to political ideals, shaped political life, and galvanized political debate from antiquity to the present. We consider the relation between visual representation and political representation, addressing how artists and architects have responded to the demands of democracy, empire, war, and revolution, and how individuals and communities have reacted with and against the works that they produced. Topics span from propaganda to public monuments, icons to iconoclasm, civic buildings to border walls, and from the politics of display to political censorship. Ranging from painting, sculpture, prints, and photography to architecture, landscape design, and military fortification, this course aims to de-center ‘western’ notions of artistic achievement in its multi-media and transnational scope. Lectures and assignments emphasize close looking and close reading, skills which are essential to making us better viewers and citizens. Open to all, including those with no prior background in art history. Sections will include visits to collections and sites across Yale campus.",

It aims to explore mechanisms of diffusion, shared themes, and common visions between the revolutionary upheavals in the United States, France, Haiti, South America, Greece, and Italy. How similar and how different were these episodes? Did they emerge against a common structural and societal backdrop? Did they equally serve their ideals and liberate their people against tyranny? What was the role of women and the position of ethnic minorities in the fledgling nation-states? As the year 2021 marks the bicentennial of the Greek Revolution of 1821, special attention is given to the intricate links forged between Greek revolutionary intellectuals and their peers in Europe and other continents",

        "description": "This seminar focuses on women artists of the 19th and 20th centuries in Western Europe and the United States, while also looking back to the Renaissance through the 18th centuries, and forward to our own \"global\" moment. Beginning with the advent of feminist art history, it moves chronologically, intertwining the history of women artists with such questions as: What are the pros and cons of singling out women artists? What were the institutional restraints on women's entering the the canon of \"great\" art? How did conceptions of \"femininity,\" female agency, and the \"male gaze\" intersect with the history of art by women? How did women's roles as artist's patrons or models inflect their own or others' activities as artists? How did the political revolutions of the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries change things for women artists? How did the public and private spheres of modernity shape the role of women in the story of \"modernism\"? How did the first, second, and third waves of feminism address the problem of the women artist? How did/do matters of sex and gender intersect with those of race and class in the identity politics of contemporary world art? What is feminist art? This class is offered in tandem with the YUAG exhibition \"On the Basis of Art: 150 Years of Women at Yale,\" and culminates in a conference addressed to the two key terms of \"Woman/Artist.\"",

Urgent questions in contemporary museology include: Can we decolonize the museum? How can museums become more inclusive? Should collections be returned to communities of origin? This course examines the recent literature on the history of art museums, opening up theoretical and methodological as well as substantive and historical issues. It also provides a broad survey of the development of the art museum from the French Revolution to the present day. Issues under investigation include: the formation of histories for art through the hanging of collections; questions of representation of women, ethnic and cultural groups in museum collections; the definition and promulgation of nationalism and ‘schools’ of art; the relationship between the art museum and Modernism; contemporary artists and the museum gallery spaces and the making of publics for art; the processes of acquisition, cataloguing and display by institutions; the social and educational role of the art museum; the relationship between art museums and colonialism; museums in the post-colonial world; museums and race today.",

Models are constrained by physical principles, including conservation laws and experimental observations but this does not provide a closed description. There is a lot more art in mathematical modeling than is commonly acknowledged and improvisation plays a significant role.  The artistic aspects are important and intellectually engaging because they often lead to a deeper understanding. This course provides a general introduction to engineering analysis and to chemical engineering principles. Material includes the derivation of governing equations from first principles and the analysis of these equations, including underlying assumptions, degrees of freedom, dimensional analysis, scaling arguments, and approximation techniques. The goal of this course is to obtain the necessary skills for improvising mathematical models for a broad range of problems that arise in engineering, science and everyday life.

This course introduces students to the study of language through the lens of English word structure, with occasional glances at the structure of words in other languages of the world. We study different ways of forming new words from prefixes and suffixes, as well from compounding, blending, and other more exotic processes. We study the sound structure of words and how they are used in sentences. We study what happens when English adopts words from other languages, and when English words are used in other languages, and how words change their sound, shape, and meaning over time. Finally, we discuss the different 'effects' that different words might have in conversation, and the issues that word choice raises in society at large.",

Readings from Plato, Aristotle, Confucius, Bhagavad-Gita, Virginia Woolf, Martin Luther King, Max Weber, and others. One hour of lecture plus two hours of discussion weekly. Hybrid course with in-person lectures, which will also be recorded and available for remote enrollment.",

        "description": "Mathematical modeling is not a scripted procedure. Models are constrained by physical principles, including conservation laws and experimental observations but this does not provide a closed description. There is a lot more art in mathematical modeling than is commonly acknowledged and improvisation plays a significant role.  The artistic aspects are important and intellectually engaging because they often lead to a deeper understanding. This course provides a general introduction to engineering analysis and to chemical engineering principles. Material includes the derivation of governing equations from first principles and the analysis of these equations, including underlying assumptions, degrees of freedom, dimensional analysis, scaling arguments, and approximation techniques. The goal of this course is to obtain the necessary skills for improvising mathematical models for a broad range of problems that arise in engineering, science and everyday life. Students from all majors are encouraged to take this course.",

From the family and the home to the workplace, from the University, and the Corporation, to the Military and Media, we track how inequalities emerge and are sustained by power and institutional structures. We also see how they are challenged and what sorts of instruments are needed to challenge them. In particular, we focus on sexual politics and sexual violence as a key issue to understanding the gendered workings of institutions, in order to examine structures that sustain inequality. Through the semester, we hope to consider many domains of life–bedrooms and boardrooms, international borders and feminist movements–to understand the stubborn and sticky forms and hierarchies of power that are challenged and contested by activists, scholars, and communities.",

This century has seen great advances in technology, health, alternative energies, new forms of communication, but also vast consolidations of power, mass incarceration, climate change, poverty, homelessness, wars, state surveillance, and sexual violence. Our current historical moment increasingly asks us to craft broader and deeper connections between personal, local, national, and international issues. This course explores cultural criticism on a range of issues that examine the intersections of history, politics, media, and various crises in the 21st century by writers from a variety of backgrounds: journalists, academics, activists, artists, scientists, and politicians. We analyze how these writers use their professional expertise to craft work for the public arena, and what it means to create a history of the present. The course’s four sections cover various responses to some of the issues most publicly contested across college campuses nationwide, and here at Yale: racial unrest, sexual assault, climate change, poverty, incarceration, fascism, and gun violence.",

This century has seen great advances in technology, health, alternative energies, new forms of communication, but also vast consolidations of power, mass incarceration, climate change, poverty, homelessness, wars, state surveillance, and sexual violence. Our current historical moment increasingly asks us to craft broader and deeper connections between personal, local, national, and international issues. This course explores cultural criticism on a range of issues that examine the intersections of history, politics, media, and various crises in the 21st century by writers from a variety of backgrounds: journalists, academics, activists, artists, scientists, and politicians. We analyze how these writers use their professional expertise to craft work for the public arena, and what it means to create a history of the present. The course’s four sections cover various responses to some of the issues most publicly contested across college campuses nationwide, and here at Yale: racial unrest, sexual assault, climate change, poverty, incarceration, fascism, and gun violence.",

The key objective of the course is for students to conceive of and implement creative uses of computation. To this end, skills to be obtained during the course are as follows: (1) appreciate the current efforts and motivation to push the limitations of computation for creative expression, both in new application and new foundational research; (2) weigh factors such as cost, power, processing, memory, I/O capabilities, and networking capabilities when choosing a set of embedded devices and sensors; (3) contextualize unfamiliar hardware and languages through examples, documentation, and familiar design pattern; and (4) manage communication between multiple languages, devices, and protocols. Additionally, at the end of the course students will have a portfolio of their work in the form of writing, code, video, audio, and physical artifacts.",

Informed by American studies, gender studies, and religious studies, the course considers celebrity a way to talk about how popularity is an embodied and spiritualized appraisal. The bibliography on celebrity and politics is not a robust one, despite the fact that winning elections requires popularity and in the last twenty years of American politics some conscientiousness of the skill sets celebrities mastered seems a precondition for electoral success. The course assembles a range of scholarly and archival resources to think about what it means to achieve celebrity, and how it is a political form of public life. Of particular interest is how to think about the construction of magic and charisma, and how those very idioms often contribute to accusations of mesmerism and manipulation. Written assignments focus students on developing celebrity as an applied knowledge for social media development and political progress.",

        "course_id": 220311877,
        "description": "The focus of this course is gay, lesbian, and queer writing from the period between Whitman and Stonewall. How did queer writers find an audience in the years before the emergence of a gay/lesbian public? What languages of identity and sexuality did they develop? The course begins with Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, writing before the idea of sexual minorities took hold. We read some late 19C writers in their wake, including Charles Warren Stoddard, and the literary culture of the \"Boston marriage,\" before turning to the conjunction of sexual culture and modernism. Queer modernism has been much studied in recent years, including such figures as Wilde, Freud, Joyce, Woolf, Stein, Barnes, Firbank, Crane, Thurman, Hughes, and Proust; in the same years, a language of homosexual rights began to develop with such works as Imre, by Edward Prime Stevenson. Many of the writers in the period explored unsettled sexualities and worlds of abjection, in ways that can still disturb readers. They influenced one another across the Atlantic and across genres. We touch on the British and Irish writers who came of age after WWI (Isherwood, Auden, Spender, Ackerley, Barnes), as well as the paradigmatically queer writing of those for whom queerness was linked to a language of criminality—notably Jean Genet, Patricia Highsmith, and William Burroughs. Students are encouraged to pursue research projects in each of these moments, reaching up to the Beats (Burroughs, Ginsberg, Kerouac), the New York poets (O’Hara, Ashbery, Schuyler) the San Francisco Renaissance (Spicer, Duncan, Broughton), Southern queer writers (McCullers, Capote, Williams), black queer writing after the Harlem Renaissance (Baldwin, Hansberry), and other figures of the 60s from both high literary and underground backgrounds (Nabokov, Elizabeth Bishop, Joe Orton, and Vidal, but also Jack Smith, Jane Rule, and Iceberg Slim). Along the way we talk about the various ways that these writers charted a queer take on the world, including their engagements with criminality and psychopathology—the main connotations of queerness in the period—as well as the development of a queer language of abjection and its advantages for life. Students are encouraged to delve into the rich holdings of the Beinecke for research projects not limited to the writers on the syllabus, including the lesbian pulp fiction collection and holdings in the related fields of photography, film, and other arts.",

For some, the university has always upheld the interests of traditional elites, privilege and inequality; for others, it should be a transformative institution for overcoming social ills and divisions of class, race, religion, and gender. Beginning with classic nineteenth-century writers including Tocqueville, Arnold, Newman, and Hardy on education and cultural aspiration, the course examines major twentieth-century exponents of the bildungsroman, künstlerroman, and campus novel forms, including distinguished works by Forster, Joyce, Woolf, Waugh, Mary McCarthy, Du Bois, Gandhi, Fanon, Tayib Salih, and J. M. Coetzee, and then concludes with notable twenty-first century works on this subject by Zadie Smith, Jeffrey Eugenides, and Sally Rooney.",

        "course_id": 220311877,
        "description": "The focus of this course is gay, lesbian, and queer writing from the period between Whitman and Stonewall. How did queer writers find an audience in the years before the emergence of a gay/lesbian public? What languages of identity and sexuality did they develop? The course begins with Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, writing before the idea of sexual minorities took hold. We read some late 19C writers in their wake, including Charles Warren Stoddard, and the literary culture of the \"Boston marriage,\" before turning to the conjunction of sexual culture and modernism. Queer modernism has been much studied in recent years, including such figures as Wilde, Freud, Joyce, Woolf, Stein, Barnes, Firbank, Crane, Thurman, Hughes, and Proust; in the same years, a language of homosexual rights began to develop with such works as Imre, by Edward Prime Stevenson. Many of the writers in the period explored unsettled sexualities and worlds of abjection, in ways that can still disturb readers. They influenced one another across the Atlantic and across genres. We touch on the British and Irish writers who came of age after WWI (Isherwood, Auden, Spender, Ackerley, Barnes), as well as the paradigmatically queer writing of those for whom queerness was linked to a language of criminality—notably Jean Genet, Patricia Highsmith, and William Burroughs. Students are encouraged to pursue research projects in each of these moments, reaching up to the Beats (Burroughs, Ginsberg, Kerouac), the New York poets (O’Hara, Ashbery, Schuyler) the San Francisco Renaissance (Spicer, Duncan, Broughton), Southern queer writers (McCullers, Capote, Williams), black queer writing after the Harlem Renaissance (Baldwin, Hansberry), and other figures of the 60s from both high literary and underground backgrounds (Nabokov, Elizabeth Bishop, Joe Orton, and Vidal, but also Jack Smith, Jane Rule, and Iceberg Slim). Along the way we talk about the various ways that these writers charted a queer take on the world, including their engagements with criminality and psychopathology—the main connotations of queerness in the period—as well as the development of a queer language of abjection and its advantages for life. Students are encouraged to delve into the rich holdings of the Beinecke for research projects not limited to the writers on the syllabus, including the lesbian pulp fiction collection and holdings in the related fields of photography, film, and other arts.",

Centered around a semester-long, slow reading of writer Saidiya Hartman’s Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments: Intimate Histories of Social Upheaval, we study full-length texts by Zora Neale Hurston, Nella Larsen, Paule Marshall, Ntozake Shange and June Jordan and critical texts by black feminist scholars to uncover stories of radical black girls and women and to study the methods writers and scholars use to bring these stories to life. Our primary goals are to sharpen our skills as readers, writers, and thinkers and to develop an analysis of how real-world hierarchies (of race, of class, of gender, of sexuality, of ability, of age) have given shape to some of the most beautiful and urgent prose, poetry, philosophy, and criticism of the contemporary world. We place our work in literature and theory in conversation with music and visual art, and our journey along wayward lines will take us to Yale’s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscripts Library, the Yale University Art Gallery, and beyond.",

        "description": "What do ancient fifth-century Athens and turn-of-the-(twentieth-)century Vienna have in common? In fact, psychoanalysis’ development was intertwined with Freud’s interpretations of classical Greek tragedy, and Greek tragedies in turn can shed light on psychoanalytic concepts in excess of Freud’s readings. The juxtaposition of these two worlds allows us to understand each with a fresh perspective. And this is what we study in this class: we read and interpret the best-known tragic plays by ancient playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides in dialogue with key concepts of psychoanalytic criticism. Well-established questions that Greek tragedy raises about gender politics, the evolution of democracy, the progressive disintegration of the Athenian polis, the construction of citizenship and foreignness, the influence of rhetoric and sophistry is reframed in dialogue with Freud’s (and his followers’) redefinitions of language, the unconscious, the self, trauma, violence, and gender. The goal of this course is to provide students with a clear understanding of the historical evolutions of these two forms of cultural production while also engaging in more theoretical and comparative work of literary interpretation and critical theorization. Considering the pivotal role that both psychoanalysis and Greek tragedy held in the development of later currents of thoughts (including postcolonial studies, Black Studies, feminist theory, queer theory, and Black studies), particular attention is paid the afterlives of the Freudian method and classical tragedy.",

After which, we discuss techniques to describe an image, from edges to feature descriptors and methods to establish correspondences between different images of the same scene. The course additionally covers topics in recognition (i.e. image classification, segmentation, detection, etc.) and reconstruction (i.e. stereo, structure-from-motion, optical flow). Machine learning and deep learning based methods in a subset of the topics covered are also introduced.

For instance, there is the mystery of how people remain hidden from themselves―of repressed impulses and buried truths that find expression in fantasies, dreams, and other strange visions. A word for this mystery is the unconscious. Some terms for its literature include the gothic and the grotesque. Our experimental course pursues this mystery by studying two writers working in different languages, in different centuries, in a variety of minor, unprestigious genres: Edgar Allan Poe and Franz Kafka. We use tales and other short texts by each writer to illuminate the other’s techniques for examining the psychological and political unconscious.",

        "description": "A studio-based exploration of the epochal shift in choreographic aesthetics known as postmodern dance. In the early 1960s, a cohort of young artists redefined what dance could be and do. Influenced by the composer John Cage, these artists invented new movement vocabularies and compositional forms. Through re-staging seminal dances from the 1960s and 1970s, we consider the social and political contexts in which postmodern dance emerged; its links to minimalism, sculpture, and experimental music; and its ongoing influence on twenty-first century global contemporary dance. The course includes a field trip to New York City to attend the reconstruction of Yvonne Rainer’s dance \"Parts of Some Sextets\" (1965), which premieres in November in the Performa 19 Biennial. This class is open to students of all physical abilities and backgrounds; special accommodations will be crafted in the event of specific disabilities.",

For instance, there is the mystery of how people remain hidden from themselves―of repressed impulses and buried truths that find expression in fantasies, dreams, and other strange visions. A word for this mystery is the unconscious. Some terms for its literature include the gothic and the grotesque. Our experimental course pursues this mystery by studying two writers working in different languages, in different centuries, in a variety of minor, unprestigious genres: Edgar Allan Poe and Franz Kafka. We use tales and other short texts by each writer to illuminate the other’s techniques for examining the psychological and political unconscious.",

Crichton wrote thrilling stories that also asked his readers to consider what monsters humans could make if they didn’t stop to consider whether or not they should.

        "description": "This course is intended for undergraduate physics, chemistry, engineering, computer science, statistics and data science, and mathematics majors seeking an introduction to quantum information science. There is now a second quantum revolution underway and a world-wide race to build powerful new types of computers based on quantum principles, and to develop new techniques for encrypted communication whose security is guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics. The approach of this course to these topics will strip away much of the traditional physics details to focus on the information content of quantum systems, the nature of measurement, and why the true randomness of certain measurement results can be a feature rather than a bug. We learn what it means for a quantum bit (‘qubit’) to be simultaneously 0 and 1 (in some sense). We learn about quantum entanglement and the associated ‘spooky action at a distance’ that convinced Einstein that the quantum theory must be wrong. Ironically, this bizarre effect is now used on a daily basis to prove that quantum mechanics is indeed correct and used as a routine engineering test to make sure that quantum computers are working properly and are truly quantum. Specific topics include: the mathematical representation of quantum states as complex vectors, the superposition principle, entanglement and Bell inequalities, quantum gates and algorithms for quantum computers, quantum error correction, dense coding, teleportation, and secure quantum communication. Students learn to do problem sets based on programming and operating publicly-accessible cloud-based quantum computers. See for example: https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/.",

The focus of the course includes both client- and server-side programming (and database programming), client/server communication, user interface programming, and parallel programming. This course is designed for students who have taken CPSC 223 (but do not need CPSC 323 or higher-level computer science systems courses) and wish to learn the complete programming framework of Web programming. For a systematic treatment of core software engineering techniques, using Web programming as a running example framework, consider taking CPSC 439, which targets students with more extensive programming experiences (after CPSC 323).",

As a nation, our drug use ranges from everyday activities, such as drinking coffee or beer, to combating illnesses with prescription medications, to using illegal drugs for recreation. This course follow a loose chronology beginning in the early twentieth century and ending in the present day. Instead of focusing on the biography of a single drug, or class of drugs, this course incorporates a wide range of substances, including alcohol, cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, psychedelics, and narcotics. Through a selection of essays, book chapters, and primary source material, we discuss how certain ways of using and selling drugs have been sanctioned and encouraged, while others have been pathologized as addiction or criminalized. We explore how drug definitions are constructed, how they shift over time, and how they reflect, reinforce, and sometimes challenge anxieties about race, disability, sexuality, and gender. Throughout the course, films, images, music, and television episodes are also presented as objects of analysis to provide insight into the cultural lives of drugs. We explore how historians approach this subject, assess their sources and assumptions, and consider the choices they have made in researching and writing. Students are expected to apply these historical lessons to the present and demonstrate the ability to think and write critically about the history of drugs.",

        "description": "Since the Lumère brothers filmed their female employees leaving the factory in 1895, the \"working girl\" has become a familiar fixture of films around the world. This seminar approaches this archetypal modern character as a foundational figure for film history and important vernacular link for national film industries competing with Hollywood. We begin by asking: what is a working girl? How has the category changed over the course of the 20th century, as it has circulated around the globe? And how can we turn it into a heuristic device for feminist film history, despite its fraught ideological construction? With these questions in mind, we launch our investigation in the US and Europe and then move onto the Soviet Union, Japan, China, India, Mexico, and Senegal, reading novels, classic film theory, and local cultural histories of gendered labor alongside films about shop girls, dancing girls, telephone girls, factory girls, office girls, laundresses, and maids. Topics to be discussed include working girls as moviegoers, cultural imperialism and vernacular modernism, migration and mass reproduction, sex as work and workplace romance, and contradictions of capital and care. In this class, students learn to conduct comparative, multi-media close analyses of film texts and read global film history through the globalization of modern gendered labor.",

This course examines how contemporary black writers have imagined and attempted to represent black life from the late 17th to the early 20th centuries, asking what fiction can tell us about history. Reading these works as alternative archives, or \"counternarratives,\" which index the excess and fugitive material of black histories in the Americas, we probe the uses, limits, and revelations of historical fictions, from the experimental and realist novel, to works of poetry and drama. Drawing on the work of various interdisciplinary scholars, we use these historical fictions to explore and enter into urgent and ongoing conversations around black life & death, African-American history & memory, black aesthetics, and the problem of \"The Archive.\"",

This course examines how contemporary black writers have imagined and attempted to represent black life from the late 17th to the early 20th centuries, asking what fiction can tell us about history. Reading these works as alternative archives, or \"counternarratives,\" which index the excess and fugitive material of black histories in the Americas, we probe the uses, limits, and revelations of historical fictions, from the experimental and realist novel, to works of poetry and drama. Drawing on the work of various interdisciplinary scholars, we use these historical fictions to explore and enter into urgent and ongoing conversations around black life & death, African-American history & memory, black aesthetics, and the problem of \"The Archive.\"",

        "description": " Many today believe that the model of representative government that we have inherited from its 18th century founders is broken. It is seen as too oligarchic, disconnected, and unresponsive to the demands of 21st century citizens and, as such, no longer fitting the ideal of democracy that it was supposed to render possible in large, industrial societies. In this course we explore possible reforms and alternatives to the existing political and social system from both empirical and normative perspectives. We try to think both beyond representation by looking at new ways in which citizens can directly affect policy-making by either working with or by-passing entirely elected officials, and beyond government itself, by questioning the assumed divide between the political and the economic spheres and interrogating the internal structure and governance of the workplace.",

        "description": "This seminar centers the analytics and methods that feminist and queer ethnographic analyses have brought to the fore to revisit a cluster of topical issues, this year assembled around the theme: Family, Community, Nation. As a site in which personhood is distributed and contested, the \"family\" is one of the building blocks of social scientific analysis—along with \"community\" and \"nation.\" Seen as ideological lynchpins for the reproduction of the social order, processes of family-making—like marriage, divorce, childbirth, and intergenerational flows—have been codified differently across historical and cultural contexts. This course engages the feminist and queer ethnographies that revealed the political hierarchies that emerge from seemingly natural categories and distinctions of kinship. We trace the gendered, sexualized, class-making, and racialized concepts, processes, and implicit understandings of family-making that chart the public and private spheres of community and national terrains. Students grapple with the processes of naturalization and denaturalization through which the \"political\" is mobilized and dyads like kin/kith, blood/soil, human/nonhuman, citizen/noncitizen, us/them, are made to appear. We also engage with feminist and queer methodologies that conjure up speculative fabulations for, what Saidiya Hartman has called, \"the radical hope for living otherwise.\" We do so at a time when the global Covid-19 pandemic has demanded the resurgence of the state, tested community ties, transformed family arrangements, and isolated most of the world’s population within domestic domains.",

Attention is also paid to famous stage and screen adaptations of the novel: what do they get right and what do they get wrong? Taught in English, no knowledge of French is required.",

        "description": "This seminar centers the analytics and methods that feminist and queer ethnographic analyses have brought to the fore to revisit a cluster of topical issues, this year assembled around the theme: Family, Community, Nation. As a site in which personhood is distributed and contested, the \"family\" is one of the building blocks of social scientific analysis—along with \"community\" and \"nation.\" Seen as ideological lynchpins for the reproduction of the social order, processes of family-making—like marriage, divorce, childbirth, and intergenerational flows—have been codified differently across historical and cultural contexts. This course engages the feminist and queer ethnographies that revealed the political hierarchies that emerge from seemingly natural categories and distinctions of kinship. We trace the gendered, sexualized, class-making, and racialized concepts, processes, and implicit understandings of family-making that chart the public and private spheres of community and national terrains. Students grapple with the processes of naturalization and denaturalization through which the \"political\" is mobilized and dyads like kin/kith, blood/soil, human/nonhuman, citizen/noncitizen, us/them, are made to appear. We also engage with feminist and queer methodologies that conjure up speculative fabulations for, what Saidiya Hartman has called, \"the radical hope for living otherwise.\" We do so at a time when the global Covid-19 pandemic has demanded the resurgence of the state, tested community ties, transformed family arrangements, and isolated most of the world’s population within domestic domains.",

We focus our efforts on major authors and texts that define and redefine the modern medical humanities, and medicine as it is practiced today. Readings include works by Anton Chekhov, Mikhail Bulgakov, Atul Gawande, Lisa Sanders, Rivka Galchen, Jerome Groopman, and shorter pieces by many others. A field trip to the Yale Medical Historical Library is planned.",

The topics that demographers or population scientists study range from health disparities in the United States, the impact of AIDS on population health in Africa, migration patterns from Latin America, the reasons behind sex-selective abortions in Asia, the implications of low fertility in Europe, and the socioeconomic impact of COVID19. Understanding population dynamics is crucial to professionals in a diversity of careers and industries. For example, city planners, environmental engineers, and health policy experts all use demographic expertise about population growth, migration patterns, and health and longevity in decisions on issues such as how many schools a city should build, how much water a region needs over twenty years, and what type of public health initiatives would best serve a community. Professionals in business also rely on demographic knowledge to make decisions about which markets to enter, what products are needed, and how to best market their products. In this course, students explore the key concepts and measures used to study population dynamics.",

        "description": "The martial arts film has not only been a central genre for many East Asian cinemas, it has been the cinematic form that has most defined those cinemas for others. Domestically, martial arts films have served to promote the nation, while on the international arena, they have been one of the primary conduits of transnational cinematic interaction, as kung-fu or samurai films have influenced films inside and outside East Asia, from The Matrix to Kill Bill. Martial arts cinema has become a crucial means for thinking through such issues as nation, ethnicity, history, East vs. West, the body, gender, sexuality, stardom, industry, spirituality, philosophy, and mediality, from modernity to postmodernity. It is thus not surprising that martial arts films have also attracted some of the world’s best filmmakers, ranging from Kurosawa Akira to Wong Kar Wai. This course focuses on films from Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea—as well as on works from other countries influenced by them—covering such martial arts genres such as the samurai film, kung-fu, karate, wuxia, and related historical epics. It provides a historical survey of each nation and genre, while connecting them to other genres, countries, and media.",

        "description": "How do we know when something is racist? And how do we prove it to those who are skeptical? This course is designed to allow students to go beyond armchair pontificating about racism by exploring a broad range of ways social theorists have defined the term and methods they have used to demonstrate it. Together, we have the opportunity to read, critique, and synthesize scholarship from across disciplines, with the goal of refining our own definition of the term. To accomplish this, we examine the stakes of calling something racist, who benefits and who suffers from a given definition, and how racism functions across contexts (mostly) within the United States. We also learn about popular methods for demonstrating that an idea, feeling, behavior, person, or institution is racist and evaluate how evidence about racism (or lack thereof) can obscure a diagnosis of racism—or lead to an erroneous one. Throughout the course, we take opportunities to translate the theoretical and methodological lessons we learn to the world we live in today, from popular culture to dinner table conversations.",

The first part of the course, \"Modes of Revolt,\" proceeds by tracking accounts of slave rebellion, anti-colonial struggle, and labor organizing. The second part of the course, \"Modes of Exploitation,\" includes readings on slave societies, wage labor, imperialism, settler colonialism, gender and social reproduction, and ideologies of race. Students engage with both classic and contemporary works by thinkers including Karl Marx, Rosa Luxemburg, W.E.B. Du Bois, Frantz Fanon, Walter Rodney, Stuart Hall, Barbara Fields, Robin D.G.

        "description": "Since the so-called Age of Discovery, the Pacific has been conceptualized as a crossroads between the East and the West. By the twentieth century, places like Hawaiʻi came to be idealized as harmonious multicultural societies. Drawing from works within Indigenous studies, ethnic studies, and critical race studies, students will address themes of sovereignty, settler colonialism, diaspora, and migration in order to interrogate and problematize the concept of the multicultural ‘melting pot’ across time. This course draws upon a number of disciplinary approaches to race, space, power, and culture to address questions that are central to people living across the Pacific and those who seek \"R&R\" in those \"far away\" places.",

The program, in The Kitchen’s words, \"sought to feature voices that had often been marginalized within many discussions of AIDS, in particular people of color and women.\"This course builds upon and is inspired by this aspect of Atlas's visionary presentation, an aspect that used the show to produce a critically multicultural platform that could activate cultural histories and critical traditions from various communities. In effect, the course uses this aspect as a metonym for the racial, gender, sexual, and class heterogeneity of queer art and organizing. It conducts its investigation by looking at a variety of primary materials that illustrate the heterogeneous makeup of queer and trans politics. The course also draws on more recent texts and visual works that arose from the earlier contexts that the primary texts helped to illuminate and shape.",

        "description": "This seminar approaches the two most studied phases of Italian history, the Renaissance and the 20th century, by placing what we call 'otherness' at the center of the picture rather than at its supposed margins. The main aim is to challenge traditional accounts of Italian culture, and to look at pivotal events and phenomena (the rise of Humanism, the rise of fascism, courtly culture, the two World Wars, 16th century art, futurism) from the point of view of Black, Queer, and Jewish protagonists, authors, and fictional characters. Our theoretical bedrock is offered by modern and contemporary thinkers such as Fred Moten, Edouard Glissant, Eve Sedgwick, and Hannah Arendt. Our primary sources come from cultural epicenters of Renaissance, Baroque, and late Modern Italy, such as Leo X papal court, fascist Ferrara, 17th century Venice, and colonial Libya. In class, we adopt a trans-historical, intersectional, and interdisciplinary perspective inspired by current scholarship and early modern ideas of temporality, identity, and belonging. Themes and issues are analyzed at the crossing of the two historical phases and of the three topics in exam, and the material includes historical and theoretical analyses, narrative texts, poems, films, and visual art.",

Maple sugar is a forest product unique to northeastern North America, and it has seen a resurgence in interest as global consumers seek nutritious, natural, and sustainably produced foods. This course covers the booming industry and culture around maple syrup, from backyard operations through modern 100,000-tap investment operations. Maple producers are on the front lines of climate change and forest health threats. The course provides students with the knowledge of how challenges related to forest health and climate change are directly impacting maple producers and how these producers are learning to adapt in ways that are environmentally friendly, ecologically sound, and financially competitive in a global market.",

How does music lend nuance to seemingly self-explanatory distinctions between identity groups, allowing us to reimagine history? What is the sound of Jewishness? Who decides what a Jew sounds like? In this course we look at the ways in which music helps define group identity and blurs distinctions between majority and minority cultures. Through a perusal of historical essays, musicological analysis, primary sources, and extensive listening and singing we delve into the musical cultures of the Jewish diaspora. Exploring Jewish music practices provides insight into ideas concerning borderlands, cultural mixing, communal preservation and change, and the role of longing in shaping musical practice. Dividing up the semester into three sections, we begin with an introduction to conceptual Keywords that drive our study of Jewish musics. Next we delve into Area Studies and drink deep from a variety of musical genres from across a sampling of important geographical and cultural settings. Finally, we introduce the idea of Musical Modernity, and think through the ways in which musical forms emerging from marginalized communities can express political and social participation in and resistance to the life of modern nation states.",

The program, in The Kitchen’s words, \"sought to feature voices that had often been marginalized within many discussions of AIDS, in particular people of color and women.\"This course builds upon and is inspired by this aspect of Atlas's visionary presentation, an aspect that used the show to produce a critically multicultural platform that could activate cultural histories and critical traditions from various communities. In effect, the course uses this aspect as a metonym for the racial, gender, sexual, and class heterogeneity of queer art and organizing. It conducts its investigation by looking at a variety of primary materials that illustrate the heterogeneous makeup of queer and trans politics. The course also draws on more recent texts and visual works that arose from the earlier contexts that the primary texts helped to illuminate and shape.",

While the language that characterized the foundation of the nation-states in the 19th century was emancipation, in the second part of the twentieth century, and particularly around 1968, Latin America embraced the world discourse of liberation. This seminar examines languages of liberation in an array of disciplines and artistic practices from South and Central America as well as the Caribbean. We explore regional debates that were also inserted in the larger discourse of the anti-colonial struggles of the global South. Topics include Philosophy of liberation (Dussel), Theology of liberation (the 1968 Council of Bishops in Medellin, Colombia), Theater of the oppressed (Boal), Pedagogy of the oppressed (Freire), Cinema of liberation (manifestos of Third Cinema), the New Song protest movements across the region (both Spanish and Portuguese American music), anti-colonialism in the Caribbean (Césaire, Fanon), anti-neocolonialism (dependency theory, internal colonialism), Indigenous liberation (from the Barbados declarations to the Lacandon jungle declarations), experimental \"boom\" literature (Cortázar) etc.",

        "description": "Mikhail Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita is the most popular Russian novel of the twentieth century. Its plot, which describes the Devil’s visit to Moscow in the 1930s, has no analogues in modern Russian literature: it mixes ingeniously the elements of adventure, romance, history, philosophy, fantasy, and satirical novels. Bulgakov worked on his magnum opus for twelve years, from 1928 and until his death in 1940. The novel, however, was not published until 1966, when the first section appeared in the magazine Moskva, which sold out within hours. For contemporary readers, Bulgakov’s text is a treasure trove of insight about society, culture, morality, economics, power, religion, entertainment, politics, police, and everyday life in the Stalin era. But Bulgakov also raises deep philosophical issues: the various chapters of The Master and Margarita are case studies dealing provocatively and in depth with the meaning of life and the fear of death, good and evil, love and loyalty, ethics and responsibility, and so much more. As a bonus, the final chapters offer us Bulgakov’s own recipe for happiness. During the semester, we dive into the intricacies of Bulgakov's narrative, studying not only the structure, content, and characters of the novel, but also—through some visual sources and scholarly articles—the history of Stalinist Moscow, and the textual sources that permeate the book, from the Bible, Goethe’s Faust, and Dante’s The Divine Comedy, to Gogol and Pushkin, to Bulgakov's fellow writers and philosophers.",

        "description": "Mikhail Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita is the most popular Russian novel of the twentieth century. Its plot, which describes the Devil’s visit to Moscow in the 1930s, has no analogues in modern Russian literature: it mixes ingeniously the elements of adventure, romance, history, philosophy, fantasy, and satirical novels. Bulgakov worked on his magnum opus for twelve years, from 1928 and until his death in 1940. The novel, however, was not published until 1966, when the first section appeared in the magazine Moskva, which sold out within hours. For contemporary readers, Bulgakov’s text is a treasure trove of insight about society, culture, morality, economics, power, religion, entertainment, politics, police, and everyday life in the Stalin era. But Bulgakov also raises deep philosophical issues: the various chapters of The Master and Margarita are case studies dealing provocatively and in depth with the meaning of life and the fear of death, good and evil, love and loyalty, ethics and responsibility, and so much more.

We’ approach this period of music history by delving into how \"regular people\"—especially women—consumed, curated, and created music in their everyday lives. Austen, an accomplished musician herself, wove music into her novels in ways that reveal much about contemporary practices of (and prejudices against) musicking. We focus on three of Austen’s novels (Pride & Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility, Emma) and excerpts from her music manuscript collections, alongside recent scholarship and modern film adaptations, which taken together raise a series of interdisciplinary questions. By learning about Austen's musical milieu, we open up the musical lives of Regency-era women and the \"middling sort,\" while becoming more attuned to the social critiques embedded in Austen's representations of music, ultimately enriching our engagement with the novels themselves.",

Austen, an accomplished musician herself, wove music into her novels in ways that reveal much about contemporary practices of (and prejudices against) musicking. We focus on three of Austen’s novels (Pride & Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility, Emma) and excerpts from her music manuscript collections, alongside recent scholarship and modern film adaptations, which taken together raise a series of interdisciplinary questions. By learning about Austen's musical milieu, we open up the musical lives of Regency-era women and the \"middling sort,\" while becoming more attuned to the social critiques embedded in Austen's representations of music, ultimately enriching our engagement with the novels themselves.",

        "description": "This class introduces the fundamentals of Buddhist thought, focusing on the foundational doctrinal, philosophical, and ethical ideas that have animated the Buddhist tradition from its earliest days in India 2500 years ago down to the present, in places such as Tibet, China, and Japan. Though there will be occasional discussion of the social and practical contexts of the Buddhist religion, the primary focus of this course lies on how traditional Buddhist thinkers conceptualize the universe, think about the nature of human beings, and propose that people should live their lives. Our main objects of inquiry are therefore the foundational Buddhist ideas, and the classic texts in which those ideas are put forth and defended, that are broadly speaking shared by all traditions of Buddhism. In the later part of the course, we take up some of these issues in the context of specific, regional forms of Buddhism, and watch some films that provide glimpses of Buddhist religious life on the ground.",

        "description": "This course is intended for undergraduate physics, chemistry, engineering, computer science, statistics and data science, and mathematics majors seeking an introduction to quantum information science. There is now a second quantum revolution underway and a world-wide race to build powerful new types of computers based on quantum principles, and to develop new techniques for encrypted communication whose security is guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics. The approach of this course to these topics will strip away much of the traditional physics details to focus on the information content of quantum systems, the nature of measurement, and why the true randomness of certain measurement results can be a feature rather than a bug. We learn what it means for a quantum bit (‘qubit’) to be simultaneously 0 and 1 (in some sense). We learn about quantum entanglement and the associated ‘spooky action at a distance’ that convinced Einstein that the quantum theory must be wrong. Ironically, this bizarre effect is now used on a daily basis to prove that quantum mechanics is indeed correct and used as a routine engineering test to make sure that quantum computers are working properly and are truly quantum. Specific topics include: the mathematical representation of quantum states as complex vectors, the superposition principle, entanglement and Bell inequalities, quantum gates and algorithms for quantum computers, quantum error correction, dense coding, teleportation, and secure quantum communication. Students learn to do problem sets based on programming and operating publicly-accessible cloud-based quantum computers. See for example: https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/.",

We draw upon a diverse range of scholarship across the social sciences as well as history, architecture, and philosophy to better understand how we find ourselves in this present \"age of walls\" (Tim Marshall 2019). In addition, we take a comparative approach to the study of borders—examining specific contemporary and historical cases across the world in order to gain a comprehensive view of what borders are and how their meaning and function has changed over time. And because there is \"critical\" in the title, we explicitly evaluate the political consequences of borders, examine the sorts of resistances mobilized against them, and ask what alternative social and political worlds might be possible.",

Instead of focusing on the biography of a single drug, or class of drugs, this course incorporates a wide range of substances, including alcohol, cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, psychedelics, and narcotics.

We explore how drug definitions are constructed, how they shift over time, and how they reflect, reinforce, and sometimes challenge anxieties about race, disability, sexuality, and gender. Throughout the course, films, images, music, and television episodes are also presented as objects of analysis to provide insight into the cultural lives of drugs.

Both TFs put in really thoughtful work. Paul Turner was a fantastic professor and an amazing lecturer. I never missed or skipped a class because each one was so engaging and interesting. The environment of the class was very chill and led for me to explore my interests in a way that fulfilled me and left me stress free. After taking this course I feel very confident in my major. As for Thomas Near he also was a great professor and showed so much care for each of his students. He was funny and engaging. Thus leading to  leading to a fun and encouraging environment to learn in. Once again in Bio 104 I also had a great TF Yulan Lu which left me really interested in what we were learning. Then for Chem lab 136 I had a superstar TF Raibat Sarker how would take time to also help me with my lab even zoom with just me to explain things when I was so lost."

But political actors, scholars, and everyday citizens often struggle with the concept of abolition. Even if we’re deeply concerned about police violence, we might not be able to envision a world without prisons and police—let alone imagine the role we might play in its creation. Or if we do embrace abolition as a \"lodestar\"—an aspirational ideology that guides us—we might still conceive of it as a distant future that we are largely powerless to achieve. Students leave this course with a deep understanding of abolition and of prefiguration as a theory of social change. They develop greater familiarity with the American prison and policing systems, history of social movements, transformative justice, and community building. Students leave this course better prepared to engage with and to critique movements for social change.",

What is the appropriate moral response to this history? This turns out to be a complex and difficult question, or set of questions, which we explore in this course. Some of these are issues of philosophical theory, however, of \"nonideal theory,\" where the questions concern not what is ideally just, but what responses are called for by historical injustice. But there are also important empirical historical issues concerning the precise character of the injustices and who, and what institutions, were complicit in them. We examine, as best we can, the history of chattel slavery and its long legacy: the white reaction to what Du Bois called \"black reconstruction,\" racist violence and terror, and decades of white supremacy, including segregation in all its forms and, most recently, mass incarceration.

        "description": "The history of chattel slavery and its long legacy, even to the current moment, is a history of almost unimaginable injustice. What is the appropriate moral response to this history? This turns out to be a complex and difficult question, or set of questions, which we explore in this course. Some of these are issues of philosophical theory, however, of \"nonideal theory,\" where the questions concern not what is ideally just, but what responses are called for by historical injustice. But there are also important empirical historical issues concerning the precise character of the injustices and who, and what institutions, were complicit in them. We examine, as best we can, the history of chattel slavery and its long legacy: the white reaction to what Du Bois called \"black reconstruction,\" racist violence and terror, and decades of white supremacy, including segregation in all its forms and, most recently, mass incarceration. Ultimately, however, our questions are philosophical. What response does justice require to this history and of whom is it required?",

The course focuses on six trans-historical objects (or modes) of visionary experience: God(s), Paradise, Cosmos, Self, Text, and Future. We journey into and explore together visionary landscapes and material ranging from communion with Native American ancestral deities to the cosmic forms of the Hindu god Krishna, from the paradises of John Milton and William Blake to the futuristic dystopias of Stanley Kubrick and Mamoru Oshii, from the angelic orders of Hildegard von Bingen to the metatextual theatrics of Buddhist sūtras, from the ever-expanding self of Walt Whitman to the self-transcending consciousness of Shakespeare’s Hamlet. Friday sessions alternate between writing workshops and field trips to Yale collections.

Students will encounter a range of literature, film, music and performance, material culture, and food culture. Students will apply a critical eye to the ways Central Asians have constructed their identities and their region, and the ways outsiders have represented and misrepresented Central Asia across time. The course begins with a historical overview of the region through a critical analysis of several popular misconceptions. In three subsequent units, focused on steppe nomadism, urban life, and mobility and migration, students will critically engage with the ways that colonialism, authoritarianism, neoliberalism, and other political forces have shaped Central Asian lifeways and cultures. Students will visit the Beinecke Library and the Peabody Museum to encounter a range of Central Asia-related holdings at Yale. In an on-campus concert and a cooking demo, students will also encounter the Central Asian diaspora communities in New York and Connecticut.",

We focus on personal films by filmmakers who consider themselves artists, activists, or agents of change but are united in their use of the nonfiction format to speak truth to power. In different ways, these films use media to build community and build family and ultimately, to build family albums and archives that future generations can use to build their own practices. Just as the family album seeks to unite people across time, space, and difference, the films and texts explored in this course are also journeys that culminate in linkages, helping us understand nuances of identity while illuminating personal relationships to larger cultural, social, and historical movements.",

Ecstasy derives from the Greek ekstasis, meaning \"to stand outside (of oneself),\" and the term has been used in various cultural and historical contexts to describe modes of experiential and intellectual transcendence in traditions of ritual, mysticism, performance, hermeneutics, literary theory and criticism, poetry, and poetics. The course takes primarily structural, psychological, and phenomenological approaches to the topics of ecstasy and the ecstatic in religion and literature, in order to think through what ecstasy \"is,\" when and why it happens, what it achieves, and how it does so. The course explores the relationship between ecstasy and other religious categories such as doctrine, praxis, ethics, faith, and service. Likewise, we locate ecstasy as a major element in poetic traditions, and its relationship to metaphor, poetic influence, demonic possession, and the Sublime.",

Ecstasy derives from the Greek ekstasis, meaning \"to stand outside (of oneself),\" and the term has been used in various cultural and historical contexts to describe modes of experiential and intellectual transcendence in traditions of ritual, mysticism, performance, hermeneutics, literary theory and criticism, poetry, and poetics. The course takes primarily structural, psychological, and phenomenological approaches to the topics of ecstasy and the ecstatic in religion and literature, in order to think through what ecstasy \"is,\" when and why it happens, what it achieves, and how it does so. The course explores the relationship between ecstasy and other religious categories such as doctrine, praxis, ethics, faith, and service. Likewise, we locate ecstasy as a major element in poetic traditions, and its relationship to metaphor, poetic influence, demonic possession, and the Sublime.",

We grapple with the normative questions of what constitutes bias, fairness, discrimination, or ethics when it comes to data science and machine learning in applications such as policing, health, journalism, and employment. We incorporate technical precision by introducing quantitative measures that allow us to study how algorithms codify, exacerbate and/or introduce biases of their own, and study analytic methods of correcting for or eliminating these biases. Lastly, we study the social implications of these decisions, and understand the legal, political and policy decisions that could be used to govern data-driven decision making by making them transparent and auditable. We read critical commentary by practitioners, state-of-the-art technical papers by data scientist and computer scientists, and samples of legal scholarship, moral and ethical philosophy, readings in sociology, and policy documents. We often ground our discussions around recent case studies, controversies, and current events.",

As a nation, our drug use ranges from everyday activities, such as drinking coffee or beer, to combating illnesses with prescription medications, to using illegal drugs for recreation. This course follow a loose chronology beginning in the early twentieth century and ending in the present day. Instead of focusing on the biography of a single drug, or class of drugs, this course incorporates a wide range of substances, including alcohol, cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, psychedelics, and narcotics. Through a selection of essays, book chapters, and primary source material, we discuss how certain ways of using and selling drugs have been sanctioned and encouraged, while others have been pathologized as addiction or criminalized. We explore how drug definitions are constructed, how they shift over time, and how they reflect, reinforce, and sometimes challenge anxieties about race, disability, sexuality, and gender. Throughout the course, films, images, music, and television episodes are also presented as objects of analysis to provide insight into the cultural lives of drugs. We explore how historians approach this subject, assess their sources and assumptions, and consider the choices they have made in researching and writing. Students are expected to apply these historical lessons to the present and demonstrate the ability to think and write critically about the history of drugs.",

As a nation, our drug use ranges from everyday activities, such as drinking coffee or beer, to combating illnesses with prescription medications, to using illegal drugs for recreation. This course follow a loose chronology beginning in the early twentieth century and ending in the present day. Instead of focusing on the biography of a single drug, or class of drugs, this course incorporates a wide range of substances, including alcohol, cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, psychedelics, and narcotics. Through a selection of essays, book chapters, and primary source material, we discuss how certain ways of using and selling drugs have been sanctioned and encouraged, while others have been pathologized as addiction or criminalized. We explore how drug definitions are constructed, how they shift over time, and how they reflect, reinforce, and sometimes challenge anxieties about race, disability, sexuality, and gender. Throughout the course, films, images, music, and television episodes are also presented as objects of analysis to provide insight into the cultural lives of drugs. We explore how historians approach this subject, assess their sources and assumptions, and consider the choices they have made in researching and writing. Students are expected to apply these historical lessons to the present and demonstrate the ability to think and write critically about the history of drugs.",

What is more, the argument continues, because of this harmony, all benefited materially and culturally from diversity and interaction. Through careful reading of primary sources, students take a critical look at convivencia as both historical concept and practice. To what degree did tolerance exist in medieval Spain? And perhaps more critically, what do religious interactions in the distant past tell us about the possibilities for religious tolerance in the future.",

        "description": "Ever since the establishment of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in 1948 and the Korean War (1950–1953), North Korea has been depicted by the media as a reclusive, oppressive, and military country, its leaders as the worst dictators, and its people as brainwashed, tortured, and starving to death. The still ongoing Cold War discourse, intensified by the North Korea’s recent secret nuclear weapons program, furthers these negative images, and outsiders have passively internalized these images. However, these simplistic characterizations prevent one from gaining a balanced understanding of and insight into North Korea and its people on the ground. Topics other than political, military, and security issues are rarely given attention. On the whole, even though North Korea’s land area is larger than South Korea and its population of 25 million accounts for a third of all Koreans, North Korea has been neglected in the scholarly discussion of Korean culture. This class tries to make sense of North Korea in a more comprehensive way by integrating the political and economic with social, cultural, and religious dimensions. In order to accomplish this objective, students examine leadership, religious (especially cultic) aspects of the North Korean Juche ideology, the daily lives of its citizens, religious traditions, the Korean War, nuclear development and missiles, North Korean defectors and refugees, human rights, Christian missionary organizations, and unification, among others. Throughout, the course places North Korean issues in the East Asian and global context. The course draws upon recent scholarly books, articles, journals, interviews with North Korean defectors, travelogues, media publications, and visual materials.",

Most countries, in constructing their national identity, point to shared language, culture, or ethnicity. The United States, on the other hand, has been called a \"nation of immigrants,\" a \"melting pot,\" or a \"mosaic.\" These terms seek to describe how disparate groups of people from all over the globe have come together to form a nation. In this course, students grapple with questions of who has been considered \"American\" at different points in U.S. history, how the boundaries of this U.S national community have been policed, and why those boundaries have changed over time to allow some to become American while continuing to exclude others.",

How do they attempt to fashion old material into new poetic visions? How do poets hear echoes from the past and amplify, distort, and transform what they hear into their own unique voices in the present? And what’s really at stake in such transformations? (Why write a poem, after all?) This course reads a trajectory of poetic influence in English language poetry that stretches from Shakespeare into the twenty-first century, paying particular attention to the development of a variety of specific tropes across poems and across poets. We also read various essays, prefaces, and letters, written by poets, that attempt to articulate what a poem is and does, who or what a poet is and does, and what the value of reading and writing poetry may be, for anyone.",

We focus on cutting-edge research in humans and animals aimed at understanding the biological mechanisms that underlie psychiatric illness. Although these questions date back to early philosophical texts, only recently have experimental psychologists and neuroscientists begun to explore this vast and exciting domain of study. We discuss the evolutionary and developmental origins of individual differences in human personality, measurement issues, fundamental dimensions of psychopathology, stability/plasticity, heritability, and implications therapeutic interventions as well as the associated broader implications for public policy. A major focus is on the neurobiology of fear and anxiety, including brain circuits, molecular genetic pathways, and epigenetics. A secondary focus is on differences in behavior and biology that confer risk for the development of depression and addiction, including the biological systems involved in hedonic pleasure, motivated goal pursuit, and the regulation of impulses in the face of everyday temptation.",

It sheds new light on the life of the highest elite members and the royal family on one hand and on the other, it is possible to also get insights into the daily lives of its inhabitants who often lived rather harsh lives as can be deduced from the forensic evidence, which was obtained during the excavation of several large cemeteries. The aim of this seminar is to explore the rich archaeological evidence from old and new fieldwork projects at the site and to analyze these results within the wider political and cultural frameworks of ancient Egyptian history. In addition, we evaluate whether we can consider Amarna as a source for the study of urban society in Egypt or whether this city was an exceptional case that stood out from the rest of the country.",

The course draws examples from both South and Southeast Asia--among our aims is to examine who in their field has challenged or reimagined the conventional boundaries of area studies. The class is designed to serve as preparation for qualifying examinations across a range of fields and as a starting point for students who envisage dissertation projects that engage with these areas of scholarship. Our focus, throughout, is on archives, approaches, and methodologies (including new approaches to research that have been necessitated by the pandemic). Readings and topics are tailored to the interests of the students in the class.  Students have the choice of writing a historiographical paper or producing an original research paper.",

For some, another language might be natively known, or laboriously acquired to the point of fluency in adult years; others may live with a second language that has been partially lost, suppressed, or broken (and perhaps later revived and reclaimed). We read poems, plays, short stories, and novels in which various proficiencies in another language are met with restlessness, exuberance, anxiety, humor, and ingenuity. Thinking about how language and identity are bound together in vital and surprisingly elastic ways, we consider how knowledge of a second language can impress itself on the imagination, on literature—even on one’s very sense of self. This course helps students acquire critical reading and writing skills, with a particular focus on close reading, textual analysis, formulating academic arguments, and essay-writing.",

For some, another language might be natively known, or laboriously acquired to the point of fluency in adult years; others may live with a second language that has been partially lost, suppressed, or broken (and perhaps later revived and reclaimed). We read poems, plays, short stories, and novels in which various proficiencies in another language are met with restlessness, exuberance, anxiety, humor, and ingenuity. Thinking about how language and identity are bound together in vital and surprisingly elastic ways, we consider how knowledge of a second language can impress itself on the imagination, on literature—even on one’s very sense of self. This course helps students acquire critical reading and writing skills, with a particular focus on close reading, textual analysis, formulating academic arguments, and essay-writing.",

        "description": "The overarching aim of the course is to understand the unfolding Covid-19 pandemic in Africa in the context of a century of pandemics, their political and administrative management, the responses of ordinary people, and the lasting changes they wrought. The first eight meetings examine some of the best social science-literature on 20th-century African pandemics before Covid-19. From the Spanish Influenza to cholera to AIDS, to the misdiagnosis of yaws as syphilis, and tuberculosis as hereditary, the social-science literature can be assembled to ask a host of vital questions in political theory: on the limits of coercion, on the connection between political power and scientific expertise, between pandemic disease and political legitimacy, and pervasively, across all modern African epidemics, between infection and the politics of race. The remaining four meetings look at Covid-19. We chronicle the evolving responses of policymakers, scholars, religious leaders, opposition figures, and, to the extent that we can, ordinary people. The idea is to assemble sufficient information to facilitate a real-time study of thinking and deciding in times of radical uncertainty and to examine, too, the consequences of decisions on the course of events. There are of course so many moving parts: health systems, international political economy, finance, policing, and more. We also bring guests into the classroom, among them frontline actors in the current pandemic as well as veterans of previous pandemics well placed to share provisional comparative thinking. This last dimension is especially emphasized: the current period, studied in the light of a century of epidemic disease, affording us the opportunity to see path dependencies and novelties, the old and the new.",

        "description": "Virtually every American today \"does\" drugs. As a nation, our drug use ranges from everyday activities, such as drinking coffee or beer, to combating illnesses with prescription medications, to using illegal drugs for recreation. This course follow a loose chronology beginning in the early twentieth century and ending in the present day. Instead of focusing on the biography of a single drug, or class of drugs, this course incorporates a wide range of substances, including alcohol, cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, psychedelics, and narcotics. Through a selection of essays, book chapters, and primary source material, we discuss how certain ways of using and selling drugs have been sanctioned and encouraged, while others have been pathologized as addiction or criminalized. We explore how drug definitions are constructed, how they shift over time, and how they reflect, reinforce, and sometimes challenge anxieties about race, disability, sexuality, and gender. Throughout the course, films, images, music, and television episodes are also presented as objects of analysis to provide insight into the cultural lives of drugs. We explore how historians approach this subject, assess their sources and assumptions, and consider the choices they have made in researching and writing. Students are expected to apply these historical lessons to the present and demonstrate the ability to think and write critically about the history of drugs.",

How does social change play out in literature, and, in turn, what role might literature play in social change? Where does the category of the ‘literary’ come from, and how does it relate to key political categories such as ‘the people’? How might literature—and the arts generally—be of use to us in our attempts to create a more just, free, and equal society? How might a more just, free, and equal society allow us to relate to literature and the arts? On the literary side, our writers may include William Wordsworth, Jane Austen, W.B.

The theoretical framework for the seminar interrogates (1) the status of biography as a literary genre, (2) the problems that attend the study of ethnicity and identity in antiquity, and (3) authoritative figures in ancient religious traditions. Selections of the Life of Moses are read in Greek while the entire work in English translation is discussed. We also consider a broader selection of modern scholarship and ancient literature in translation. An advanced Greek option is open to students with at least two years of Ancient Greek (equivalent to the L5 level). The seminar includes invited guest speakers as well as a trip to the Beinecke to examine material evidence for ancient education. Area I.",

        "description": "This class introduces modern symmetric and public-key cryptography as well as their broad applications, both from a theoretical and practical perspective. There is an initial emphasis on fundamental cryptographic primitives (e.g., block ciphers, pseudorandom functions, pseudorandom generators, one-way functions), their concrete efficiency and implementation as well as their security definitions and proofs. Ways of combining such primitives that lead to more complex objects used to secure today’s internet (e.g., via TLS), such as key exchange, randomized encryption, message authentication codes and digital signatures are also studied. The last part of the class is devoted to modern and more advanced applications of cryptography (some of which are deployed at scale today), such as authenticated data structures, zero-knowledge proofs, oblivious RAM, private information retrieval, secret sharing, distributed consensus and cryptocurrencies (e.g, Bitcoin).",

However, despite the obvious social justice implications of literacy, rates remain unacceptably low in most countries, especially in marginalized under-resourced communities. Scientific research on the neurocognitive foundations of fluent reading and writing has expanded considerably in recent years, and a growing body of research also points to how under-resourced environments can put neurocognitive outcomes at risk. Despite this progress, there remain significant academic, political, cultural, and economic factors barriers that can prevent effective translation from \"research to classroom (or clinic)\", and these difficulties are amplified for under-resourced communities and vulnerable populations globally. We explore these topics with a special focus on diverse populations including language minority and indigenous communities, children at risk from early exposure to stress and violence, and neuro-diverse children (e.g., sensory loss, language disorders). We also examine the promise (and potential pitfalls) of innovative programs that leverage tools from artificial intelligence (and general education technology) in an attempt to expand global literacy access.",

In addressing these questions, this course charts the economic, political, and cultural transformations of postcolonial Africa from the 1960s to the present.

Students engage in a wide variety of interdisciplinary activities such as drawing, sculpting, painting, printing, photography, reprographics, instrument-building and sound broadcasting.

In this course, students consider how artists and inventors have used seemingly unrelated materials and content in order to activate creative thinking and generative activity. Students engage in a wide variety of interdisciplinary activities such as drawing, sculpting, painting, printing, photography, reprographics, instrument-building and sound broadcasting. This course emphasizes experimenting with strategies for generating ideas, images and objects, and employs broad modes of creating, including elements of chance, spontaneity, collaborating communally, and synthesizing disparate elements into the process of making.",

Reading the novel closely, we pose the following questions: In what ways is it a national and an imperial novel? What myths does it destroy and construct?  What is the relation of fiction to history? And what forces drive history, as it unfolds in the present? To what extent do individuals control their own lives and, if they’re emperors and generals, the lives of nations? Finally, how does one live a meaningful life as a private person and as a member of a society? We explore these questions while refining our tools of literary analysis and situating the novel in its historical context.

Russians developed their own versions of Manifest Destiny, Orientalism, and colonialism. As a result of imperial expansion, the Russian Federation to this day remains a multiethnic state and, territorially, the biggest country on Earth. This interdisciplinary course explores Russia’s imperial culture, history, and politics from the nineteenth century to the present day. The course focuses on how modern Russian culture represented empire and how imperial subjects responded to these representations. It also asks how nationalism and racialization figured in these negotiations. Cultural materials include fiction, non-fiction, poetry, travel writing, painting, monuments, and films. Secondary readings draw on history, political science, anthropology, and contemporary journalism.",

        "description": "This seminar centers the analytics and methods that feminist and queer ethnographic analyses have brought to the fore to revisit a cluster of topical issues, this year assembled around the theme: Family, Community, Nation. As a site in which personhood is distributed and contested, the \"family\" is one of the building blocks of social scientific analysis—along with \"community\" and \"nation.\" Seen as ideological lynchpins for the reproduction of the social order, processes of family-making—like marriage, divorce, childbirth, and intergenerational flows—have been codified differently across historical and cultural contexts. This course engages the feminist and queer ethnographies that revealed the political hierarchies that emerge from seemingly natural categories and distinctions of kinship. We trace the gendered, sexualized, class-making, and racialized concepts, processes, and implicit understandings of family-making that chart the public and private spheres of community and national terrains. Students grapple with the processes of naturalization and denaturalization through which the \"political\" is mobilized and dyads like kin/kith, blood/soil, human/nonhuman, citizen/noncitizen, us/them, are made to appear. We also engage with feminist and queer methodologies that conjure up speculative fabulations for, what Saidiya Hartman has called, \"the radical hope for living otherwise.\" We do so at a time when the global Covid-19 pandemic has demanded the resurgence of the state, tested community ties, transformed family arrangements, and isolated most of the world’s population within domestic domains.",

        "description": "This seminar centers the analytics and methods that feminist and queer ethnographic analyses have brought to the fore to revisit a cluster of topical issues, this year assembled around the theme: Family, Community, Nation. As a site in which personhood is distributed and contested, the \"family\" is one of the building blocks of social scientific analysis—along with \"community\" and \"nation.\" Seen as ideological lynchpins for the reproduction of the social order, processes of family-making—like marriage, divorce, childbirth, and intergenerational flows—have been codified differently across historical and cultural contexts. This course engages the feminist and queer ethnographies that revealed the political hierarchies that emerge from seemingly natural categories and distinctions of kinship. We trace the gendered, sexualized, class-making, and racialized concepts, processes, and implicit understandings of family-making that chart the public and private spheres of community and national terrains. Students grapple with the processes of naturalization and denaturalization through which the \"political\" is mobilized and dyads like kin/kith, blood/soil, human/nonhuman, citizen/noncitizen, us/them, are made to appear. We also engage with feminist and queer methodologies that conjure up speculative fabulations for, what Saidiya Hartman has called, \"the radical hope for living otherwise.\" We do so at a time when the global Covid-19 pandemic has demanded the resurgence of the state, tested community ties, transformed family arrangements, and isolated most of the world’s population within domestic domains.",

We focus our efforts on major authors and texts that define and redefine the modern medical humanities, and medicine as it is practiced today. Readings include works by Anton Chekhov, Mikhail Bulgakov, Atul Gawande, Lisa Sanders, Rivka Galchen, Jerome Groopman, and shorter pieces by many others. A field trip to the Yale Medical Historical Library is planned.",

        "description": "This first-year seminar is the first of a two-part sequence designed for students in the Science, Technology and Research Scholars (STARS) program, and other first-year students interesting in studying the physical and mathematical sciences.  In the first semester, students encounter on-going research at Yale and in the broader scientific community across physics, astronomy, geology, computer science and data science.  Skills necessary to understand, write, and present research in these areas are developed. In the second semester, students identify a Yale research mentor and prepare an independent grant proposal to prepare for summer research. The organizational structures and best practices associated with scientific research are examined. Credit for SCIE 020 is given only upon successful completion of SCIE 021.  One course credit, one SC or WR credit, is awarded after successful completion of both courses.\n\nCorequisite: Students must enroll in an appropriate introductory course sequence in Physics or Computer Science.",

Yet, feminine, queer, androgynous, and non-binary perspectives on sex and identity played a central role–from Rimbaud to current experimentalism–in the historical development of literary and artistic experimentalism, especially in Italy. In this seminar we cross the history of literary and artistic vanguardism through the material, textual, and phonetic records left behind by experimentalists who did not identify as men. We read poems that are actually images, look at paintings conceived as texts, listen to audio-performances, and treat the avant-garde as an archaeological stratigraphy of bodies, emotions, objects, and ideas.",

From the family and the home to the workplace, from the University, and the Corporation, to the Military and Media, we track how inequalities emerge and are sustained by power and institutional structures. We also see how they are challenged and what sorts of instruments are needed to challenge them. In particular, we focus on sexual politics and sexual violence as a key issue to understanding the gendered workings of institutions, in order to examine structures that sustain inequality. Through the semester, we hope to consider many domains of life–bedrooms and boardrooms, international borders and feminist movements–to understand the stubborn and sticky forms and hierarchies of power that are challenged and contested by activists, scholars, and communities.",

        "description": "Fans have long celebrated rock’s revolutionary politics, but what role did it play in countries where people believed that the final revolution, ‘the Communist Revolution,’ had already happened? Officially panned and sometimes banned in many socialist states, rock ‘n’ roll nevertheless enjoyed a strong base of fans and practitioners in Eastern Europe and Eurasia throughout the 1960s, ‘70s, and ‘80s. The role of rock in these countries, however, was more complex than celebratory stories of resistance and Western consumption in the face of Communist \"oppression\" might have us believe. In this seminar, we examine original (translated) songs and reviews from Communist Europe and the Soviet Union and more recent critical essays, plays, (auto)biographies, films, and performances commenting on rock in the late-Socialist period to frame larger questions of political voice, censorship, cooptation, counterculture, and (counter)revolution. The seminar introduces students to accessible music terminology, but no musical background is required for the course.",

These are all words in the English language, but, like all words, they have different meanings, functions, and social purposes; indeed, the meaning and function may be different for the same word depending on the context in which we use it (whether spoken or written). In this course, we explore the wonderful world of words. We look at how we create new words (and why), how we change the meaning of words, and how words have been lost (and revived) over time. As we do so, we look at debates over words and their meanings now (such as the feeling by some that ain’t is not a word at all) and historically (such as the distaste for subpeditals for ‘shoes’ in the sixteenth century), and how words can be manipulated to insult, hurt, and discriminate against others. We look at a wide range of texts by well-known authors (such as Shakespeare) as well as anonymous online bloggers, and we make use of online tools like the Google Ngram viewer and the Corpus of Historical American English to see how words change over time. At the end of the course, I hope you see how we make sophisticated use of words and how studying them opens up new ways for you to understand why other people use words the way they do and how you can use words for various purposes in your own speech and writing.",

Students engage in a wide variety of interdisciplinary activities such as drawing, sculpting, painting, printing, photography, reprographics, instrument-building and sound broadcasting. This course emphasizes experimenting with strategies for generating ideas, images and objects, and employs broad modes of creating, including elements of chance, spontaneity, collaborating communally, and synthesizing disparate elements into the process of making.",

In addition, it centers around the new computing paradigm of Cloud FPGAs, where the FPGAs are hosted remotely by cloud providers and accessed remotely by users. The theoretical aspects of the course focus on digital system modeling and design using the Verilog Hardware Description Language (Verilog HDL). In the course, students learn about logic synthesis, behavioral modeling, module hierarchies, combinatorial and sequential primitives, and implementing and testing the designs in simulation and real FPGAs. Students also learn about FPGA tools from two major vendors: for Xilinx FPGAs and Intel FPGAs (formerly Altera). The practical aspects focus on designing systems using commercial Cloud FPGA infrastructures: Amazon F1 service (Xilinx FPGAs) or through the Texas Advanced Computing Center (Intel FPGAs). Students learn about cloud computing, interfacing servers to FPGAs, PCIe and AXI protocols, and how to write software that runs on the cloud servers and leverages the FPGAs for acceleration of various computations.",

California offers an important case study through which to think historically about the complicated relationships between the environment, globalized capitalism, national politics, and individual choices within the world economy as they have intersected in a state defined by its booms and busts. The course begins with the earliest attempts by European empires to establish a foothold on the Pacific Ocean in California and concludes with California's global hegemony as a powerhouse in cultural production, technological development, agricultural output, and environmental policy. We pay particular attention to how California's culture of entrepreneurship has created both solutions to and new problems for advancements in global hunger, environmental sustainability, income inequality, labor, and media distribution.",

        "description": "Taking up the parallelism between the evolution of art, science and technology at the turn of 19th and 20th centuries, this course explores the bidirectional relationship between the art of moving pictures and the science of fundamental physical laws. Such a dual perspective, based on a selection of particularly telling movies, presents some of the crucial ideas that science and art dealt with in the last hundred years. Among these topics, we address questions tied to the nature of time and space, the relativity of motion, the role of the observer in physical phenomena, the coexistence of the visible and invisible, the possible existence of parallel universes, as well as concepts like light and matter, fields and waves, chaos and order, uncertainty and chance, teleportation and quantum entanglement, boundlessness and infinity, space curvature and gravity. A radical question also accompanies us throughout the course: Can the humanistic and scientific forms of thinking converge and merge? Can they help each other to become more aware of themselves? And finally, can the rigorous exploration of the world, the language of poets, the pleasure of the performance, the magic of discoveries, productively work together? The first part of the course (weeks 1 to 7) explores the stylistic and narrative strategies of early cinema, in their attempt to depict a new reality of the world. The second part of the course (weeks 8 to 13) introduces and discusses  ideas  of contemporary physics that have found an echo in films. This course does not require detailed knowledge of calculus.",

In addition, the General Theory of Relativity opened up for the first time a quantitative study of cosmology, of the history of the universe as a whole. Albert Einstein was at the center of these breakthroughs, and also became an iconic figure beyond physics, representing scientist genius engaged in pure research into the fundamental laws of nature. This course addresses the nature of the transition to modern physics, underpinned by quantum and relativity theory, through study of Einstein’s science, biography, and historical context. It also presents the basic concepts in electromagnetic theory, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, special theory of relativity, and quantum mechanics which were central to this revolutionary epoch in science.",

The key objective of the course is for students to conceive of and implement creative uses of computation. To this end, skills to be obtained during the course are as follows: (1) appreciate the current efforts and motivation to push the limitations of computation for creative expression, both in new application and new foundational research; (2) weigh factors such as cost, power, processing, memory, I/O capabilities, and networking capabilities when choosing a set of embedded devices and sensors; (3) contextualize unfamiliar hardware and languages through examples, documentation, and familiar design pattern; and (4) manage communication between multiple languages, devices, and protocols. Additionally, at the end of the course students will have a portfolio of their work in the form of writing, code, video, audio, and physical artifacts.",

The course focuses on technologies of knowledge and information sharing (or hoarding) as they are embedded in social and political contexts, with an emphasis on paradigm shifts and on losses and gains as new systems of information organization replace old ones. The thematic focus is on the Western tradition and on scholarly knowledge, though students may explore other traditions and parts of the world in their research projects. Class structure consists of discussion of theoretical and historical readings selected by experts followed by hands-on interaction with special collection materials and site visits. The course introduces students to the multiple collections, curators, and librarians at Yale and serves to deepen their understanding of the modern research library.",

Reading the novel closely, we pose the following questions. In what ways is this patriotic war epic also an imperial novel? What myths does it destroy and construct? How does it combine fiction and history? What forces drive history, as it unfolds in the present? What are the limits of individual agency, and how much do emperors and generals control the fates of nations and armies? Finally, a question that is never too broad for Tolstoy: what is a meaningful, well-lived life? We explore these questions while refining our tools of literary analysis and situating the novel in its historical context and in our contemporary world. Secondary materials include Tolstoy’s letters, contemporary reviews, maps, and historical sources, as well as readings in political theory, philosophy, international relations, and literary criticism.",

We read works by a wide range of literary and political thinkers from the last two-and-a-half centuries or so, reflecting especially on questions such as: What is the relationship between literature and politics? How does social change play out in literature, and, in turn, what role might literature play in social change? Where does the category of the ‘literary’ come from, and how does it relate to key political categories such as ‘the people’? How might literature—and the arts generally—be of use to us in our attempts to create a more just, free, and equal society? How might a more just, free, and equal society allow us to relate to literature and the arts? On the literary side, our writers may include William Wordsworth, Jane Austen, W.B. Yeats, Virginia Woolf, Federico Garcia Lorca, Pablo Neruda, Czeslaw Milosz, Wislawa Szymborska, Audre Lorde, Seamus Heaney, Milan Kundera.  On the political side, our thinkers may include Edmund Burke, Mary Wollstonecraft, J.S. Mill, Karl Marx, Karl Popper, Immanuel Wallerstein.",

        "description": "Humans are stupid; computers are limited. Yet a collaboration of humans and computers has led to ever more powerful and complex computer systems. This course examines the limitations of humans and computers in this endeavor and how they shape the design, implementation, and evaluation of computer systems. It surveys the empirical knowledge reported by scholars and practitioners that overcome such limitations. The lectures, reading assignments, and classroom discussions travel through psychology and philosophy and revisit important results from theoretical computer science, with a goal of elucidating the rationales behind the best practices in computer systems research and development.",

        "description": "This lecture course introduces students to a range of thinking about the relationship between literature and projects of social justice within political modernity. We read works by a wide range of literary and political thinkers from the last two-and-a-half centuries or so, reflecting especially on questions such as: What is the relationship between literature and politics? How does social change play out in literature, and, in turn, what role might literature play in social change? Where does the category of the ‘literary’ come from, and how does it relate to key political categories such as ‘the people’? How might literature—and the arts generally—be of use to us in our attempts to create a more just, free, and equal society? How might a more just, free, and equal society allow us to relate to literature and the arts? On the literary side, our writers may include William Wordsworth, Jane Austen, W.B. Yeats, Virginia Woolf, Federico Garcia Lorca, Pablo Neruda, Czeslaw Milosz, Wislawa Szymborska, Audre Lorde, Seamus Heaney, Milan Kundera.  On the political side, our thinkers may include Edmund Burke, Mary Wollstonecraft, J.S. Mill, Karl Marx, Karl Popper, Immanuel Wallerstein.",

        "description": "From where does the desire to leave the familiar and experience the unknown emerge? What is the relationship between travel and the production of knowledge? What are the cultural politics of constructing, selling, and consuming \"experiences\" of alterity? In what ways is tourism today linked to historically constituted systems of power and inequality? This interdisciplinary course draws on anthropology, history, literary criticism, and feminist, postcolonial, and critical theory to examine the social construction of travelers and the making of knowledge and power through travel. We examine the processes through which displacement and travel yield normalized claims to knowledge, enhanced selfhood, and professional expertise. Through engagement with theoretical texts, case studies, and primary documents, we think critically about privileged discourses of travel. Major course themes include the politics of authenticity, the mythic figure of the traveler, the valorization of displacement as aesthetic gain, the fantasy of \"going native,\" patterns of consumption, and the pervasive links between travel, authority, power, and knowledge. Students are encouraged to engage their own research interests and to theorize themselves as both travelers and knowledge-producers.",

Additionally, students read about contemporary issues and debates surrounding traditional medicine such as health autonomy, health disparities, medical pluralism, globalization, and proposals for the decolonization of American healthcare.

This mix of labor history, social theory, intellectual history, business history, social history, and geography also impel us to imagine the workings of American capitalism beyond the borders of the nation—to think about how capitalists and workers move through space and reshape space; the exchange of workers, ideas, technologies, and resources across national, imperial, and oceanic boundaries.",

        "course_id": 210124243,
        "description": "This seminar introduces you to several popular musical genres and explores how they are tied to racial, regional, and national identities. We examine how music is exported via migrants, return migrants, industry professionals, and the nation-state (in the case of Korean Popular Music, or K-Pop). Readings and discussions focus primarily on the British New Wave (from about 1979 to 1985) and K-Pop (1992-present), but we also discuss first-wave reggae, ska, rocksteady from the 1960s-70s, British and American punk rock music (1970s-1980s), the precursors of modern K-Pop, and have a brief discussion of Japanese City Pop. The class focuses mainly on the British New Wave and K-Pop because these two genres of popular music have strong ties to particular geographic areas, but they became or have become extremely popular in other parts of the world. We also investigate the importance of music videos in the development of these genres.",

This course studies how the line between the fake and the authentic was established, contested, and employed in ancient Greece and Rome and what role those notions have played after antiquity. Through explorations of major fakes and forgeries, the course offers an introduction to the discipline of Classics as well as a guide to critical assessment of written and visual information. Topics include the relationship between forgery and scholarship, the antiquities market, and the manipulation of the past in the service of the present. Participants improve written and oral communication skills by composing essays and giving class presentations; most importantly, they use primary and secondary sources to make succinct, well-supported arguments.",

Working through experiences of oppression, isolation, illness, and individual/collective trauma, how do artists use their immediate material conditions to investigate and document their own survival as well as to imagine new forms of resistance and collective flourishing? Alternating between seminar discussions (remote) and performance-based experiments (in-person) this course explores the theory and practice of performance art. Beginning with an examination of the ground-breaking bodies of work created by Antonin Artaud and Marina Abramovic, we go on to consider works by more than a dozen twentieth- and twenty-first century artists including Carolee Schneeman, Dread Scott, Rirkit Tiravanija, Ana Mendieta, Stelarc, Yoko Ono, Aliza Shvarts, and others. We investigate topics including ritual, gesture, duration, suffering, dwelling, prosthesis, citation, relationality, protest, intermediality, and interactivity, and we interrogate performance art's accessibility, efficacy, and marketing. Students create several small studies over the course of the semester, sharing them in safe, informal settings and are guided in the development of a culminating work of performance-based research. All physical capabilities are welcome, no prior experience in theater, visual art, or performance is required, and all assignments will be adaptable to the remote environment.",

Why is blood so often used in cultural narratives of national belonging, fear and desire, purity and impurity? This cross-divisional seminar explores the complexity of blood from the disciplinary angles of medical anthropology and the humanities. We study how cultural narratives have informed scientific research about blood and how scientific research has influenced cultural beliefs surrounding blood. Blood is a biological substance bearing a host of social meanings. It can keep communities together and tear them apart. The course establishes a transdisciplinary dialogue in order to study the complexity of blood in different cultures. We treat topics such as, among others, the role of blood in religious sacrifice; the history of blood therapies; the mythologies of vampires; the relationship of blood to ideologies of gender, class, race and ethnicity; and the roles played by blood in works of art.",

        "course_id": 200120180,
        "description": "Shakespeare today is a global phenomenon: over five hundred years after his death, the playwright’s legacy continues to flourish with new performances, reworkings, appropriations, and adaptations continuously produced across the world in a range of languages and across various media. Once exported along with the ideologies and practices of empire, Shakespeare’s works have now become an index for the complex histories of colonialism and postcolonialism as well as a crucial site for studying processes of racialization and the universalizing idea of \"the human.\" How did Shakespeare become global? Was the cultural imagination of his plays always already global, written at a time with the very notion of the modern world as we know was being shaped? This course explores the political afterlives of \"Shakespeare\" as a cultural icon and aesthetic touchstone for the Western tradition through a close reading of four plays alongside their adaptations: Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Antony and Cleopatra. We look at films, novels, manga comics, memoirs, stand-up comic routines, along with classic stagings of the plays to elucidate the themes that have made Shakespeare global—in particular, questions of race, gender, sexuality, generational conflict, and political intrigue. Authors and directors include  Akiro Kurosawa, Vishal Bharadwaj,  Janet Suzman, Iqbal Khan, James Baldwin, Sulayman Al-Bassam, Tayeb Salih, Preti Taneja,  and Derek Walcott. This is the non-intensive writing version of LITR 340 and is worth 1 credit. It meets with LITR 340. Students may earn credit for LITR 339 (1 credit) or for LITR 340 (1.5 credits) but not for both.",

We explore the modes of production of these racialized images as well as the conditions of their reception and political and philosophical analyses of this process–particularly those relating to questions of gender, class, sexuality, religion, and nation. We also explore counterstrategies, which rather than rejecting visual mass culture attempt to use it to undermine dominant images.",

This course examines these and other questions related to masculinity from a philosophical perspective. The course develops students’ understanding of masculinity as a cultural product that changes across context and time. It pays particular attention to the ways that masculinity is socially policed and reinforced, rather than a \"natural\" expression of male sex. Through combinations of academic and popular texts, students critically examine language surrounding masculinity (e.g., \"real man\", \"bromance\"), interlocking relationships between masculinity and other social features, such as race/ethnicity and class, social mechanisms that reproduce masculine norms (e.g., misogyny), and forces that challenge these norms (e.g., trans and queer identifications). From this groundwork, students consider the influence of masculinity on main fields of philosophy, such as epistemology, philosophy of science, ethics, and metaphysics, as well as the prospects for non-hierarchical, non-\"toxic\" forms of masculinity.",

In doing so, we navigate the terrain of Roman and Latin literature from its beginnings through Late Antiquity, examining how Romans \"wrote\" into being the province of Africa and how writers from Roman North Africa \"wrote back.\" Authors explored in this course (in Latin): Plautus, Sallust, Silius Italicus, Apuleius, Augustine, and Corippus.

Through a selection of texts from this new area of study, students consider the role of ancient texts and languages in the formation of colonial elites. Readings include both prose and poetry, written in Mexico City and its hinterland, raising questions about the relations between core and periphery and between the colonizer and the colonized. Questions of relative antiquity, race, patronage, censorship, power, and tradition are considered, among others. Secondary scholarship is assigned to provide context and to offer a guide through the methodological challenges posed by the Latin of colonial Mexico.",

How those instructional hours are spent dramatically impacts students’ academic and personal well-being. Many studies have demonstrated that teacher quality matters to students’ long-term outcomes including graduation and job placement. In this course, we delve into the essential principles of being an effective teacher, focusing specifically on the U.S. secondary classroom. Building community, designing culturally sustaining curriculum, teaching inclusively, and assessing students authentically are a handful of the principles we explore together through articles about teacher practice, video examples of classroom practice, and students opportunity to enact some of these practices during class. Each student is paired with a current secondary public school teacher across America to engage in a case study of effective teaching throughout the seminar. By the end of this course, you learn some core principles of effective teaching, gain an understanding of the complexities of enacting effective teaching practices given educational inequities, conduct a case study about effective teaching, and practice some aspects of secondary teaching.",

Covering more than seven hundred years, this course surveys the history of Latin literature by focusing on literary production from and about North Africa. Together, we explore two overarching questions: \"What is the place of Roman Africa, former territory of the Carthaginian enemy, in the Roman literary imagination?\", and \"What is the place of Rome in the Roman North African literary imagination?\". In doing so, we navigate the terrain of Roman and Latin literature from its beginnings through Late Antiquity, examining how Romans \"wrote\" into being the province of Africa and how writers from Roman North Africa \"wrote back.\" Authors explored in this course (in Latin): Plautus, Sallust, Silius Italicus, Apuleius, Augustine, and Corippus. Authors explored in translation include: Livy, Vergil, Lucan, Tertullian, Lactantius, and Claudian.",

        "description": "Children across America spend roughly 12,000 hours in school from kindergarten through grade 12. How those instructional hours are spent dramatically impacts students’ academic and personal well-being. Many studies have demonstrated that teacher quality matters to students’ long-term outcomes including graduation and job placement. In this course, we delve into the essential principles of being an effective teacher, focusing specifically on the U.S. secondary classroom. Building community, designing culturally sustaining curriculum, teaching inclusively, and assessing students authentically are a handful of the principles we explore together through articles about teacher practice, video examples of classroom practice, and students opportunity to enact some of these practices during class. Each student is paired with a current secondary public school teacher across America to engage in a case study of effective teaching throughout the seminar. By the end of this course, you learn some core principles of effective teaching, gain an understanding of the complexities of enacting effective teaching practices given educational inequities, conduct a case study about effective teaching, and practice some aspects of secondary teaching.",

        "description": "Climate change is impacting how cells and organisms grow and reproduce. Imagine the ocean spiking a fever: cold-blooded organisms of all shapes, sizes and complexities struggle to survive when water temperatures go up 2-4 degrees. Some organisms adapt to extremes, while others cannot. Predicted and observed changes in temperature, pH and salt concentration do and will affect many parameters of the living world, from the kinetics of chemical reactions and cellular signaling pathways to the accumulation of unforeseen chemicals in the environment, the appearance and dispersal of new diseases, and the development of new foods. In this course, we approach climate change from the molecular point of view, identifying how cells and organisms―from microbes to plants and animals―respond to changing environmental conditions. To embrace the concept of \"one health\" for all life on the planet, this course leverages biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biophysics, and genetics to develop an understanding of the impact of climate change on the living world. We consider the foundational knowledge that biochemistry can bring to the table as we meet the challenge of climate change.",

They are also places where power is concentrated and inequalities are (re)produced. Debates around equity are filtered through urban environments, where struggles over jobs, housing, education, mobility, public health, and public safety are front and center.

        "description": "This course is intended for undergraduate physics, chemistry, engineering, computer science, statistics and data science, and mathematics majors seeking an introduction to quantum information science. There is now a second quantum revolution underway and a world-wide race to build powerful new types of computers based on quantum principles, and to develop new techniques for encrypted communication whose security is guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics. The approach of this course to these topics will strip away much of the traditional physics details to focus on the information content of quantum systems, the nature of measurement, and why the true randomness of certain measurement results can be a feature rather than a bug. We learn what it means for a quantum bit (‘qubit’) to be simultaneously 0 and 1 (in some sense). We learn about quantum entanglement and the associated ‘spooky action at a distance’ that convinced Einstein that the quantum theory must be wrong. Ironically, this bizarre effect is now used on a daily basis to prove that quantum mechanics is indeed correct and used as a routine engineering test to make sure that quantum computers are working properly and are truly quantum. Specific topics include: the mathematical representation of quantum states as complex vectors, the superposition principle, entanglement and Bell inequalities, quantum gates and algorithms for quantum computers, quantum error correction, dense coding, teleportation, and secure quantum communication. Students learn to do problem sets based on programming and operating publicly-accessible cloud-based quantum computers. See for example: https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/.",

Creating culture objects often involves digital tools and takes place in digital domains. The effects of culture on our social lives are now typically mediated by digital platforms and devices. In this introductory course, we explore how data science is being used to measure the cultural landscape, the consumption and production of culture, and the impact of culture on society. To do so, we review current theories and methodologies, as well as conduct our own analyses of popular culture, the rhetoric and social connections underlying online extremist communities, and other topics. The course provides opportunities to practice the data science skills presented in S&DS 123 with applications to the social scientific study of culture.",

By addressing these questions, the course offers an introduction to the politics of expertise. The course is structured in three parts.

In this seminar we read sources from several disciplines that describe positive modes of conviviance. Much social thought is cynical, starting from where we are not and mapping why we haven't gotten there. Some social thought is revolutionary, looking for an exit, casting hopes toward the future. What both of these lack is contents. Without ignoring the massive difficulties involved, we try to fill this in with images of viable and livable groups, collectives, festivals, syndicates, congregations, planets.",

By looking at all of opera’s complex media—libretti, music, design, stage technology, voice types, architecture, and so on—this seminar addresses various forms and techniques of representation related to such issues as gender types, national conflict, the rise of the masses as political agent, or racial minorities. We focus on select operas (or scenes) by Rossini, Weber, Meyerbeer, Verdi, Wagner, Puccini, and Strauss, as well as their representation on today’s stages. A visit to the Metropolitan Opera is anticipated. The class is open to non-majors by permission. Interested non-majors need to be familiar with Western musical notation.",

While there has been a resurgence of interest in black theatre on and off Broadway in recent years, we look at critical works created by black writers who created spaces, slid into the cracks, and opened wide the chasms of possibility between cinema and drama. We ask: how have black artists used these two mediums to articulate a political consciousness? How have black writers built, ruptured, and amended the demands required by cultural institutions like Broadway and Hollywood? We investigate the tensions between ideas of the universal and the specific, all the while attending to the complex and complicated possibilities across two different mediums: cinema and the stage. The question of authorship in the move from stage to screen will be omnipresent as we ask what kinds of performances are possible and what new worlds can be created in those transitions?",

        "description": "African American activists have long demanded equal rights by asserting the humanity of Black people. These activists have rejected their racist treatment as animals and property by championing the qualities ascribed to Western Man. More recently, however, scholars have questioned whether claims to humanity really result in freedom and justice for all Black people. They ask, \"Does mobilizing humanity as a strategy for recognition and respect benefit Black non-men, disabled people, or the working class? What impact does this assertion of humanity have on our species’ relationship to other living beings and our environments?  Ultimately, are all people allowed to be ‘human?’\" In this course, we evaluate the category of the \"human\" by studying the challenge that the U.S. Black past and present pose to the category’s assumed neutrality. We attend to how Black peoples’ bodily experiences confirm, deny, and complicate humanness. We read poetry, short fiction, novels, and creative nonfiction to investigate what it means to live a Black life. Analyzing historical, social scientific, legal, and theoretical texts alongside literature helps us explore the debates over the power dynamics that underlie claims to humanity. Through writing and in-class discussions, we explore the relationship between race, species, and political strategy.",
